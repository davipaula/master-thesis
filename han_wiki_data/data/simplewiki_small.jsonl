It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as June, September and November are later in the year.\n\nApril begins on the same day of the week as July every year and on the same day of the week as January in leap years. April ends on the same day of the week as December every year, as each other's last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\n\nIn common years, April starts on the same day of the week as October of the previous year, and in leap years, May of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as January of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\n\nIn years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as September and December of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, June of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year.\n\nApril is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn/fall month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other.\n\nIt is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word \"aperire\", meaning \"to open\", referring to flowers opening in spring. Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar, before the start of the new year was put to January 1.\n\nQuite a few festivals are held in this month. In many Southeast Asian cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including Songkran). In Western Christianity, Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. In Orthodox Christianity, it can fall between April 4 and May 8. At the end of the month, Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30, marking the transition from winter into summer.", "paragraphs": [[[396, 326, 118, 304, 5, 107, 159, 20, 0, 409, 229, 3, 0, 62], [20, 52, 326, 6, 0, 62, 66, 3, 0, 133, 229, 12, 33, 122, 7, 344, 441, 5, 487, 30, 288, 6, 0, 62]], [[396, 1092, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 375, 359, 62, 5, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 450, 6, 9028, 62], [396, 156, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 470, 359, 62, 7, 236, 68, 76, 122, 30, 2796, 147, 122, 2725]], [[6, 861, 62, 396, 465, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 478, 3, 0, 771, 62, 5, 6, 9028, 62, 107, 3, 0, 771, 62], [6, 861, 62, 396, 1624, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 375, 3, 0, 771, 62, 5, 6, 9028, 62, 617, 5, 478, 3, 0, 771, 62], [6, 861, 62, 1040, 49, 68, 861, 62, 396, 465, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 450, 3, 0, 771, 62, 5, 6, 9028, 62, 5, 62, 1040, 49, 12, 396, 1624, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 450, 3, 0, 771, 62]], [[6, 62, 1040, 106, 861, 62, 396, 465, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 441, 5, 470, 3, 0, 1816, 62, 5, 6, 62, 1040, 106, 9028, 62, 344, 3, 0, 1816, 62], [6, 62, 1040, 106, 861, 62, 396, 1624, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 441, 3, 0, 1816, 62, 5, 6, 62, 1040, 106, 9028, 62, 304, 5, 344, 3, 0, 1816, 62]], [[396, 30, 7, 1509, 229, 6, 0, 529, 8687, 5, 7, 6588, 807, 229, 6, 0, 482, 8687], [6, 236, 8687, 20, 30, 0, 8417, 3744, 3, 478, 6, 0, 68]], [[20, 30, 3691, 7, 4, 111, 396, 169, 47, 311], [7, 861, 2314, 30, 12, 20, 326, 25, 0, 1909, 1388, 1702, 4, 310, 1910, 4, 6504, 310, 6, 1509], [170, 2314, 30, 12, 0, 311, 86, 326, 25, 41509, 0, 1622, 10765, 3, 835], [20, 30, 1447, 0, 232, 229, 6, 0, 167, 1956, 5657, 106, 0, 465, 3, 0, 50, 62, 30, 339, 4, 450]], [[1689, 7, 306, 1427, 30, 802, 6, 37, 229], [6, 109, 1981, 967, 1295, 50, 62, 30, 4686, 6, 37, 229, 488, 83894], [6, 556, 7282, 8119, 86, 30, 4686, 13, 7, 240, 118, 304, 5, 396], [6, 4219, 7282, 20, 86, 807, 118, 396, 5, 107], [22, 0, 156, 3, 0, 229, 323, 5, 529, 291, 1295, 4686, 171682, 364, 13, 396, 799, 0, 3669, 25, 1601, 75, 740]]]}, {"title": "April in poetry", "text": "Poets use ''April'' to mean the end of winter.

In India and Tibet, painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included jade carving, bronze, pottery, poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.\n\nIn Europe, after the Middle Ages, there was a \"Renaissance\" which means \"rebirth\". People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented perspective where things in the distance look smaller in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.\n\nIn the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism, Romanticism, Realism, and Impressionism.

They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals.  The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low.  This is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated, and they have less money to buy equipment. Drought and other problems sometimes cause famines.  Where yields are low, deforestation can provide new land to grow more food.  This provides more nutrition for the farmer's family, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years.\n\nIn rich countries, farms are often fewer and larger.  During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests.  Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land.  There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more.\n\nThis kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, pesticides (chemicals that kill bugs), and herbicides (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by erosion (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. Irrigation (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table.

Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees. This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.\n\nAboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in Victoria and Tasmania. The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.\n\nThe Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them.

His ship, ''HMS Endeavour'', carried the famous scientists, Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander who were going to Tahiti where they would watch the planet Venus pass in front of the Sun. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find \"Terra Australis\" (the Land of the South).\n\nThe voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found New Zealand and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon. Captain Cook named that bit of land Point Hicks. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw \"New South Wales\". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.\n\nCaptain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.", "paragraphs": [[[6, 0, 1692, 6184, 312, 17, 0, 583, 3, 35817, 114, 1440, 4, 0, 193, 3, 603, 5, 201, 494, 1692, 1370, 3255, 13, 0, 954, 3, 603], [0, 1692, 1004, 1461, 71073, 1545, 17236, 36257, 13, 7, 8914, 3, 3358, 5, 18, 596, 14050, 42, 18, 311, 1461, 71073, 607], [47, 311, 30, 288, 511, 4, 6612, 0, 300, 38, 6314, 20]], [[0, 297, 78, 30, 1085, 12, 63, 390, 30, 7, 191, 426, 607, 6, 0, 139, 12, 33, 36, 30, 6167], [39, 1545, 1451, 870, 3387, 4, 0, 1244, 2561], [26, 1370, 9774, 15150, 1619, 0, 1613, 4756, 2699, 1969, 994, 5, 6456, 178264, 38, 30, 242, 4, 25683, 111, 39, 54, 1716, 0, 4090, 7416, 1280, 6, 669, 3, 0, 1662], [1451, 3387, 1779, 985, 30, 4, 596, 17400, 47482, 0, 607, 3, 0, 139]], [[0, 8914, 3, 3358, 30, 191, 1299, 113, 39, 596, 50, 1272, 5, 8750, 248, 204, 20], [127, 39, 8750, 16240], [22, 76, 7, 1606, 1074, 10640, 38, 30, 60, 0, 16591, 1845, 607, 13, 0, 8571], [1451, 3387, 311, 12, 9315, 3, 607, 389, 10640], [39, 8750, 60, 0, 954, 5, 1451, 3387, 311, 0, 607, 12, 18, 253, 50, 139, 2510], [22, 76, 39, 8750, 75, 7, 426, 310, 1255, 42, 30, 549, 3, 2120, 5, 47441, 42, 0, 11267, 20143, 10, 565], [1969, 994, 5, 178264, 242, 12927, 5, 30, 105437, 4, 596, 12, 39, 88, 36, 346, 102, 130, 3, 0, 1189, 46, 2632, 46, 2694, 12, 39, 253, 30], [39, 5198, 3079, 3, 1189, 4, 190, 137, 4, 563]], [[1451, 3387, 253, 0, 10259, 69, 17, 44, 2147, 179, 3, 214], [18, 253, 101, 2120, 5, 3985, 5, 5198, 4614, 3404, 5, 4138], [34, 63, 30, 84, 166, 5, 84, 6043], [6, 181, 153, 3, 0, 85, 69, 339, 60, 7, 166, 5, 7, 6043, 46, 77, 12392, 4, 273, 12, 39, 261, 0, 607], [34, 0, 10259, 69, 88, 36, 261, 0, 607, 6, 12, 179], [39, 6288, 4, 0, 607, 117, 7, 2232, 6288, 4, 47, 808], [1451, 3387, 242, 163, 4, 563, 5, 1361, 0, 78, 12, 84, 48, 261, 0, 607], [37, 54, 288, 1157, 7, 5510, 747, 10, 0, 10259, 69]]]}, {"title": "Settlement", "text": "In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and gaols (jails) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.\n\nBy the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.\n\nCaptain Phillip found that Botany Bay was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was \"the finest harbor in the world!\" There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.\n\nFor the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.\n\nSomehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to Norfolk Island and to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.\n\nWhile the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.", "paragraphs": [[[6, 0, 6, 563, 264, 30, 1595, 109, 69, 30, 992, 5, 48868, 2289, 30, 549], [7, 899, 86, 30, 2422, 4, 336, 10, 7843, 7, 22894, 3, 5872], [109, 69, 30, 3927, 10, 357, 1340], [34, 1140, 39, 30, 120, 3375, 6, 48868], [456, 39, 30, 1545, 420, 4, 0, 297, 4717, 6, 453], [34, 21, 0, 0, 4717, 6, 453, 399, 0, 104, 112], [39, 30, 415, 25, 297, 1067, 5, 54, 36, 190, 563, 14174, 130, 181, 100, 563, 408, 4, 596, 7, 50, 5, 333, 42496, 241]], [[21, 0, 0, 48868, 3, 563, 30, 100, 549, 12, 14174, 30, 456, 2853, 60, 6, 22086, 167, 1370], [0, 78, 2099, 4, 159, 7, 1480, 6, 50, 139, 2510, 5, 1545, 77, 3, 0, 14174, 63], [6, 0, 58, 2877, 3, 6030, 1370, 208, 8750, 25, 8685, 1619, 14174, 11267, 2266, 7, 306, 415, 12395, 5, 575, 565, 4, 76, 10, 55, 62], [44, 329, 30, 1451, 3873, 12027], [39, 30, 4, 159, 7, 50, 4717, 22, 0, 241, 12, 1451, 3387, 33, 6314, 311, 23215, 1255, 113, 3, 64, 0, 2949, 1189, 596, 63, 21, 0, 55, 4756]], [[1451, 12027, 596, 12, 23215, 1255, 30, 2983, 5, 18082], [63, 30, 36, 181, 1903, 430], [18, 242, 17, 55, 1370, 60, 0, 954, 5, 8750, 75, 7, 353, 4593, 42, 18, 203, 30, 0, 1695, 4593, 6, 0, 85], [63, 30, 109, 357, 1255, 13, 0, 4593], [100, 18, 2099, 13, 48, 42, 33, 7, 219, 5220, 3, 1903, 430, 5, 77, 2983, 4123, 4, 607, 13], [13, 450, 0, 2808, 30, 1474, 5, 50, 139, 2510, 30, 1547, 6, 0, 311, 3, 691, 649, 3062, 3, 563, 5, 0, 50, 1480, 30, 580, 2465]], [[10, 0, 306, 62, 3, 0, 1480, 873, 30, 191, 1013], [84, 48, 6, 0, 297, 78, 33, 269, 191, 605, 59, 102, 2598, 3, 14174, 189, 30, 1545, 4, 159, 7, 50, 4717], [3291, 33, 3008, 101, 4755], [63, 30, 91, 48, 300, 38, 30, 7, 5769], [63, 30, 84, 48, 244, 0, 14174, 38, 30, 7, 11527, 7, 6062, 2737, 46, 7, 27823], [84, 48, 346, 197, 4, 5054, 0, 4935, 61, 39, 1129], [64, 3, 0, 4846, 2968], [63, 30, 84, 3387, 6850], [64, 0, 1189, 30, 494, 100, 84, 48, 346, 42, 48, 86, 30, 3623], [20, 30, 10492, 12, 1402, 6, 0, 50, 4717, 54, 2357, 3, 14075]], [[6174, 0, 333, 129, 3, 8301, 17, 7, 14131, 10, 0, 1004, 3873, 12027, 5, 170, 14131, 10, 0, 1646, 3, 565, 2274, 75, 7, 357, 328, 17, 491, 7, 1641, 74, 0, 5220, 7, 27457, 10, 17222, 5614, 5, 17122, 10, 1370], [21, 0, 63, 30, 7, 1695, 6062, 166, 10, 0, 1004], [63, 30, 52, 7, 726, 5, 7, 14174, 49592, 5, 7, 3366, 512, 42, 30, 149, 1346, 373], [3980, 33, 1635, 66, 25, 2465, 19135, 4, 7888, 583, 5, 4, 1461, 71073, 607, 14050, 5, 52, 60, 0, 954, 4, 5671, 111, 3089, 30, 6314, 5, 8330, 111, 0, 2214, 4846, 30, 596, 4, 33, 2274, 4, 7, 426, 13615], [1141, 56544, 7375, 33, 30, 938, 4, 2465, 5, 21, 5769, 30, 1474, 3747, 10238, 10, 3806, 5, 52, 1545, 1695, 12338, 137, 4, 0, 2726, 3, 563]], [[110, 0, 1480, 30, 2274, 6, 50, 139, 2510, 20, 30, 52, 2274, 6, 14050], [0, 1948, 6, 14050, 30, 181, 117, 12, 6, 563, 5, 5769, 596, 20, 1673, 4, 2274, 5413, 63]]]}, {"title": "Exploration", "text": "Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people.

Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. William Wentworth started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand democratic government. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. New South Wales Legislative Council had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the right to vote was given to all men over 21 in South Australia.

They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the British Empire, and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.\n\nIn Australia at this time, the trade unions were very strong, and they started a political party, the Australian Labor Party. Australia passed many laws to help the workers.<ref>Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission</ref>\n\nIn 1914, the First World War started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli, in the Ottoman Empire. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day. They also fought on the Western Front. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.\n\nAustralia had a really hard time in the Great Depression of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against Nazi Germany when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the Fall of Singapore by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the United States Navy, the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.\n\nWhen the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from Italy and Greece, other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon. An important new party, the Liberal Party of Australia was made by Robert Menzies in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then Gough Whitlam won for the Labor Party. Whitlam made changes, but he made the Senate unhappy and the Governor-General sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then Malcolm Fraser won a few elections for the Liberal Party.\n\nIn the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from China, Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries in Asia. Australia became more multicultural. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, than Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against dictatorships in Korea and Vietnam and later Iraq. Australian soldiers also helped the United Nations in countries like East Timor in 1999.\n\nIn 1973, the famous Sydney Opera House opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of Australian movies, actors and singers became famous around the world. In the year 2000, Sydney had the Summer Olympics.\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, then the Liberal Party under John Howard made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad recession in 1991, but when other Western countries had trouble with their economies in 2008, Australia stayed strong.\n\nToday Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like Uluru) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are refugees. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after World War Two, including around 660,000 refugees.<ref>Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</ref>\n\nJulia Gillard became the first woman Prime Minister of Australia in 2010 when she replaced her colleague Kevin Rudd of the Labor Party.", "paragraphs": [[[207, 603, 30, 36, 7, 513, 20, 30, 228, 1350, 4717, 9909, 21, 695], [39, 538, 4, 1429, 600, 4, 683, 48, 50, 123, 580, 0, 3902, 3, 603, 6], [603, 30, 149, 153, 3, 0, 297, 2552, 5, 22, 303, 91, 297, 46, 291, 4, 326, 4, 603], [34, 720, 20, 33, 47, 261, 308, 5, 47, 261, 330, 5, 1505]], [[6, 603, 22, 37, 79, 0, 312, 354, 30, 191, 562, 5, 39, 465, 7, 209, 165, 0, 803, 1068, 165], [603, 1280, 109, 264, 4, 275, 0, 266, 5, 0, 248, 4, 538, 6, 603, 803, 2799]], [[6, 0, 58, 85, 136, 465, 6, 525], [603, 1429, 6, 13, 0, 437, 3, 695, 98, 509, 2640, 3865, 5, 0, 7187, 2552], [803, 2481, 30, 1545, 4, 35519, 6, 0, 7187, 2552], [39, 838, 30992, 34, 30, 960, 21, 0, 17243], [373, 603, 2715, 37, 903, 359, 62, 13, 35113, 122], [39, 52, 838, 13, 0, 556, 669], [56, 73, 803, 30, 1916]], [[603, 33, 7, 588, 605, 79, 6, 0, 353, 4275, 3, 0, 5, 1429, 695, 6, 7, 136, 98, 3929, 509, 61, 6540, 13069, 1690, 6], [34, 6, 530, 3, 803, 2481, 30, 3388, 6, 0, 807, 3, 1353, 21, 361], [127, 361, 465, 436, 603, 5, 69, 3588, 59, 2650], [34, 17, 275, 25, 0, 104, 112, 1505, 0, 623, 30, 837], [49, 0, 136, 603, 399, 7, 383, 1409, 3, 0, 104, 112]], [[61, 0, 136, 156, 603, 998, 12, 20, 408, 109, 181, 69, 4, 3823, 0, 123, 60, 5, 4, 161], [100, 0, 78, 203, 20, 54, 190, 6, 69, 25, 525, 38, 33, 1895, 44, 163, 6, 0, 136], [20, 88, 873, 117, 1190, 0, 19384, 2754, 3693], [74, 0, 182, 62, 93, 3, 69, 326, 4, 603], [39, 326, 858, 25, 931, 5, 2107, 68, 123, 6, 525], [168, 39, 52, 326, 25, 123, 117, 1130, 5, 1628], [29, 481, 50, 165, 0, 2172, 165, 3, 603, 30, 159, 21, 893, 32805, 6, 5, 20, 320, 530, 3, 367, 25, 207, 6, 127, 21629, 55257, 320, 10, 0, 1068, 165], [55257, 159, 511, 34, 18, 159, 0, 748, 7894, 5, 0, 1004, 216, 11739, 103, 5, 352, 7, 367, 6], [127, 8532, 9902, 320, 7, 306, 367, 10, 0, 2172, 165]], [[6, 0, 109, 69, 1092, 326, 4, 603, 25, 132, 1576, 1796, 5, 68, 123, 6, 831], [603, 399, 181, 21054], [6, 0, 5, 603, 399, 48, 3, 0, 1727, 123, 6, 0, 85, 275, 21, 2398, 5, 12338], [603, 465, 312, 181, 17, 453, 73, 361], [603, 280, 0, 104, 112, 6, 136, 98, 8710, 6, 574, 5, 1576, 5, 288, 233], [803, 2481, 52, 275, 0, 104, 471, 6, 123, 117, 322, 5889, 6]], [[6, 0, 1613, 2465, 2832, 166, 310], [6, 0, 5, 530, 3, 803, 1005, 2018, 5, 2226, 399, 1613, 204, 0, 85], [6, 0, 62, 2465, 33, 0, 740, 1055]], [[6, 0, 5, 0, 1068, 165, 124, 1862, 23480, 5, 923, 14670, 127, 0, 2172, 165, 124, 279, 2506, 159, 530, 3, 511, 4, 0, 427], [603, 33, 7, 978, 2979, 6, 34, 61, 68, 556, 123, 33, 2194, 17, 44, 427, 6, 603, 1087, 562]], [[373, 603, 30, 7, 1727, 2814, 5, 590, 123], [34, 20, 149, 33, 747], [204, 3, 803, 86, 36, 169, 7, 664, 6], [7, 530, 3, 607, 6, 603, 117, 98674, 33, 30, 498, 4, 10259, 69, 34, 530, 3, 71549, 30, 149, 992, 73, 2587, 1726], [359, 62, 0, 78, 3008, 7, 365, 30355, 3, 50, 69, 25, 64, 204, 0, 85, 4, 326, 7, 5658, 4, 682, 6, 603], [158, 69, 107, 326, 113, 39, 303, 4, 88, 258, 46, 4, 682, 6, 7, 1517, 4, 1429, 44, 213, 46, 113, 39, 30, 3818], [603, 190, 93, 5658, 6, 0, 62, 49, 85, 136, 55, 488, 204], [603, 6, 2461, 603, 7, 8269, 358, 3, 205, 1206, 5], []], [[7768, 26015, 399, 0, 787, 335, 141, 3, 603, 6, 61, 67, 2451, 71, 7251, 2844, 11594, 3, 0, 1068, 165]]]}, {"title": "Politics", "text": "Australia is made up of six states, and two mainland territories.

English has been changing in this way for hundreds of years.  For example, the many millions who speak Indian English frequently add American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words from the various Indian languages. \n\nSometimes people learn American English as it is spoken in America. For example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English to sound more like their customers who call from America.

In ancient Rome it referred to all free men, or in other words, all free human beings.\n\nAd hominem can be a way to use reputation, rumors and hearsay to change the minds of other people listening.

{"title": "Algebra", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "Algebra is a part of mathematics (often called '''math''' in the United States and '''maths''' or numeracy in the United Kingdom<ref></ref> ). It uses variables to represent a value that is not yet known.  When an equals sign (=) is used, this is called an equation.  A very simple equation using a variable is: <tt>2 + 3 = x</tt>   In this example, <tt>x = 5</tt>, or it could also be said, \"x equals five\".  This is called ''solving for x''.  <ref></ref>\n\nBesides equations, there are inequalities (''less than'' and ''greater than''). A special type of equation is called the function.  This is often used in making graphs because it always turns one input into one output.\n\nAlgebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things.  Physics, engineering and computer programming are areas that use algebra all the time.  It is also useful to know in surveying, construction and business, especially accounting.\n\nPeople who do algebra use the rules of numbers and mathematic operations used on numbers.  The simplest are adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.  More advanced operations involve exponents, starting with squares and square roots.  \n\nAlgebra was first used to solve equations and inequalities. Two examples are linear equations (the equation of a straight line, <tt>y=mx+b</tt>) and quadratic equations, which has variables that are squared (multiplied by itself, for example: <tt>2*2, 3*3, or x*x</tt>).", "paragraphs": [[[15230, 30, 7, 153, 3, 6510, 456, 580, 7460, 6, 0, 104, 112, 5, 7460, 46, 103485, 6, 0, 104, 1859], [20, 234, 9141, 4, 2876, 7, 1158, 12, 30, 36, 553, 346], [61, 7, 3024, 1100, 30, 234, 37, 30, 580, 7, 8712], [7, 191, 2147, 8712, 234, 7, 9141, 30], [], [6, 37, 880, 20109, 1585], [46, 20, 86, 52, 30, 203, 1585, 3024, 174], [37, 30, 580, 4441, 10, 1585], []], [[3606, 8712, 63, 30, 15687, 333, 73, 5, 353, 73], [7, 557, 1554, 3, 8712, 30, 580, 0, 3137], [37, 30, 456, 234, 6, 159, 11400, 113, 20, 690, 890, 48, 8060, 75, 48, 2756]], [[15230, 86, 30, 234, 4, 4441, 567, 747, 113, 0, 1067, 3, 15230, 161, 6, 567, 214, 5, 223, 86, 30, 234, 4, 2876, 0, 1158, 3, 567, 873], [5787, 3939, 5, 951, 2914, 30, 237, 12, 234, 15230, 64, 0, 79], [20, 30, 52, 4699, 4, 346, 6, 1672, 916, 5, 258, 858, 1530]], [[69, 38, 88, 15230, 234, 0, 1067, 3, 223, 5, 180749, 957, 234, 13, 223], [0, 2147, 30, 1679, 45903, 25172, 5, 6586], [56, 2048, 957, 5273, 29758, 465, 17, 1249, 5, 1249, 5440]], [[15230, 30, 234, 4, 4441, 8712, 5, 15687], [55, 880, 30, 9792, 8712, 0, 8712, 3, 7, 1362, 331, 20109, 3524, 5, 38081, 8712, 42, 33, 9141, 12, 30, 1249, 25172, 21, 1003, 10, 880, 46]]]}, {"title": "History", "text": "Early forms of algebra were developed by the Babylonians and the Greek geometers such as Hero of Alexandria.

A function is like a machine you can put a number (or numbers) into and get a certain number (or numbers) out. When using functions, graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations. \n\nA graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true. Usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables. The graph is often a line, and if the line does not bend or go straight up-and-down it can be described by the basic formula <tt>y = mx + b</tt>. The variable ''b'' is the y-intercept of the graph (where the line crosses the vertical axis) and ''m'' is the slope or steepness of the line. This formula applies to the coordinates of a graph, where each point on the line is written <tt>(x, y)</tt>.  \n\nIn some math problems like the equation for a line, there can be more than one variable (''x'' and ''y'' in this case).  To find points on the line, one variable is changed. The variable that is changed is called the \"independent\" variable.  Then the math is done to make a number. The number that is made is called the \"dependent\" variable. Most of the time the independent variable is written as ''x'' and the dependent variable is written as ''y'', for example, in <tt>y = 3x + 1</tt>.  This is often put on a graph, using an ''x'' axis (going left and right) and a ''y'' axis (going up and down).  It can also be written in function form: <tt>f(x) = 3x + 1</tt>.  So in this example, we could put in 5 for ''x'' and get <tt>y = 16</tt>.  Put in 2 for ''x'' would get <tt>y=7</tt>.  And 0 for ''x'' would get <tt>y=1</tt>.

{"title": "Atom", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''The atom''' is the basic unit of matter. It is the smallest thing that can have a chemical property. There are many different types of atoms, each with its own name, atomic mass and size. These different atoms are called chemical elements. The chemical elements are organized on the periodic table. Examples of elements are hydrogen and gold. \n\nAtoms are very small, but the exact size depends on the element.  Atoms range from 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers in width.<ref></ref> One nanometer is about 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair.<ref></ref> This makes atoms impossible to see without special tools. Scientists use experiments to learn how they work and interact with other atoms.\n\nAtoms join together to make molecules: for example, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make a water molecule. When atoms join together it is called a chemical reaction.\n\nAtoms are made up of three kinds of smaller particles, called protons (which are positively charged), neutrons (which have no charge) and electrons (which are negatively charged). The protons and neutrons are heavier, and stay in the middle of the atom. They are called the nucleus. They are surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are very lightweight. They are attracted to the positive charge of the nucleus by the electromagnetic force.\n\nThe number of protons and electrons an atom has tells us what element it is. Hydrogen, for example, has one proton and one electron; the element sulfur has 16 protons and 16 electrons. The number of protons is the atomic number.

The first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the Greek philosopher Democritus, around 400 BC.<ref></ref> Atomic theory stayed as a mostly philosophical subject, with not much actual scientific investigation or study, until the development of chemistry in the 1650s.\n\nIn 1777 French chemist Antoine Lavoisier defined the term ''element'' for the first time. He said that an element was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry. Any substance that could be broken down was a ''compound''.<ref name=Brief></ref>\n\nIn 1803, English philosopher John Dalton suggested that elements were tiny, solid balls made of atoms. Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass. He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine. According to Dalton, in a certain compound, the atoms of the compound's elements always combine the same way.\n\nIn 1827, British scientist Robert Brown looked at pollen grains in water under his microscope. The pollen grains appeared to be jiggling. Brown used Dalton's atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved. This was called ''brownian motion''. In 1905 Albert Einstein used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were caused by the reactions of atoms, and by doing this he conclusively proved the existence of the atom.<ref></ref>\nIn 1869 scientist Dmitri Mendeleev published the first version of the periodic table. The periodic table groups elements by their atomic number (how many protons they have. This is usually the same as the number of electrons). \nElements in the same column, or period, usually have similar properties. For example, helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon are all in the same column and have very similar properties. All these elements are gases that have no colour and no smell. Also, they are unable to combine with other atoms to form compounds. Together they are known as the noble gases.<ref name=Brief />\n\nThe physicist J.J. Thomson was the first person to discover electrons. This happened while he was working with cathode rays in 1897. He realized they had a negative charge, unlike protons (positive) and neutrons (no charge). Thomson created the plum pudding model, which stated that an atom was like plum pudding: the dried fruit (electrons) were stuck in a mass of pudding (protons). In 1909, a scientist named Ernest Rutherford used the Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space called the atomic nucleus. Rutherford took a photo plate and covered it with gold foil, and then shot alpha particles (made of two protons and two neutrons stuck together) at it. Many of the particles went through the gold foil, which proved that atoms are mostly empty space. Electrons are so small they make up only 1% of an atom's mass.<ref></ref>\n\n\n\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr introduced the Bohr model. This model showed that electrons travel around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits. This was more accurate than the Rutherford model. However, it was still not completely right. Improvements to the Bohr model have been made since it was first introduced.\n\nIn 1925, chemist Frederick Soddy found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom.<ref></ref> \nFor example, any atom with 2 protons should be a helium atom. Usually, a helium nucleus also contains two neutrons. However, some helium atoms have only one neutron. This means they truly are helium, because an element is defined by the number of protons, but they are not normal helium, either. Soddy called an atom like this, with a different number of neutrons, an ''isotope''. To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its nucleus and add this to the name of the element. So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium-3, and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon-12. However, when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed. To prove they were real, physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the mass spectrometer.<ref></ref> The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms. By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom, neutrons must exist.\n\nIn 1937, German chemist Otto Hahn became the first person to create nuclear fission in a laboratory. He discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a uranium atom, hoping to create a new isotope.<ref></ref> However, he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a barium atom, a smaller atom than uranium. Apparently, Hahn had \"broken\" the uranium atom. This was the world's first recorded nuclear fission reaction. This discovery eventually led to the creation of the atomic bomb.\n\nFurther into the 20th century, physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom. Using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles, called quarks.\n\nThe most accurate model so far comes from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Schr\u00f6dinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus, called the electron cloud. In the electron cloud, it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be. This area is called the electron's orbital.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 1388, 14367, 326, 25, 0, 1622, 47661, 25, 36, 5, 7, 611], [0, 2245, 3862, 3, 0, 1388, 14367, 326, 25, 161, 21, 0, 1622, 11296, 141687, 204], [4065, 2314, 1087, 7, 7, 1246, 9693, 1698, 17, 36, 181, 3570, 2440, 972, 46, 806, 207, 0, 380, 3, 6422, 6, 0]], [[6, 348, 17747, 13325, 107112, 6931, 0, 570, 4736, 10, 0, 79], [18, 203, 12, 7, 4736, 30, 130, 2007, 5732, 12, 86, 36, 30, 1129, 135, 75, 68, 5732, 21, 0, 3241, 3, 6422], [130, 5732, 12, 86, 30, 1129, 135, 30, 7, 311]], [[6, 711, 11296, 279, 16226, 3419, 12, 4736, 30, 3293, 3051, 1083, 159, 3, 14367], [16226, 733, 12, 64, 14367, 3, 0, 215, 4736, 33, 0, 215, 1329], [18, 203, 12, 3990, 30, 683, 61, 14367, 3, 181, 73, 48, 4736, 6582], [200, 4, 16226, 6, 7, 1192, 3990, 0, 14367, 3, 0, 3990, 4736, 690, 6582, 0, 215, 179]], [[6, 297, 4756, 893, 1042, 662, 22, 23166, 5614, 6, 430, 124, 26, 21519], [0, 23166, 5614, 1650, 4, 30, 107186], [1042, 234, 16226, 4065, 2314, 4, 4466, 4467, 6, 0, 179, 39, 483], [37, 30, 580, 82686, 3053], [6, 4324, 14553, 234, 6510, 4, 2827, 12, 0, 6475, 5757, 926, 30, 1157, 21, 0, 2614, 3, 14367, 5, 21, 88, 37, 18, 32808, 2827, 0, 3794, 3, 0], [6, 4756, 21686, 143927, 6231, 0, 1062, 3, 0, 13789, 1801], [0, 13789, 1801, 129, 4736, 21, 44, 4065, 30355, 197, 109, 17653, 39, 33], [37, 30, 1140, 0, 215, 7, 0, 30355, 3, 13278], [2622, 6, 0, 215, 3235, 46, 566, 1140, 33, 793, 1306], [10, 880, 23321, 17696, 59231, 60682, 5, 53682, 30, 64, 6, 0, 215, 3235, 5, 33, 191, 793, 1306], [64, 37, 4736, 30, 851, 12, 33, 84, 8237, 5, 84, 9332], [52, 39, 30, 2282, 4, 6582, 17, 68, 14367, 4, 683, 3990], [600, 39, 30, 346, 7, 0, 6809, 311], [2461]], [[0, 13643, 7245, 30, 0, 899, 4, 6314, 13278], [37, 1927, 110, 18, 30, 161, 17, 35266, 3014, 6], [18, 4223, 39, 33, 7, 2563, 1090, 2633, 17653, 1335, 5, 23783, 84, 1090], [7245, 1210, 0, 18731, 21720, 1423, 42, 92, 12, 7, 14367, 30, 117, 18731, 21720, 0, 3289, 4138, 13278, 30, 4403, 6, 7, 1329, 3, 21720, 17653], [6, 7, 4756, 311, 9668, 16114, 234, 0, 32658, 32667, 5943, 4, 2827, 12, 181, 3, 7, 14367, 30, 6, 7, 191, 357, 863, 580, 0, 4065, 14605], [16114, 190, 7, 3119, 4364, 5, 1333, 20, 17, 764, 12068, 5, 127, 4088, 8546, 12886, 159, 3, 55, 17653, 5, 55, 23783, 4403, 600, 22, 20], [109, 3, 0, 12886, 242, 131, 0, 764, 12068, 42, 2827, 12, 14367, 30, 1246, 3920, 863], [17532, 30, 100, 357, 39, 159, 60, 91, 3, 7, 14367]], [], [[6, 34206, 48523, 5354, 0, 48523, 1423], [37, 1423, 273, 12, 13278, 1143, 204, 0, 14605, 6, 5054, 9713, 6960], [37, 30, 181, 5697, 73, 0, 16114, 1423], [212, 20, 30, 149, 36, 2215, 248], [5472, 4, 0, 48523, 1423, 33, 30, 159, 108, 20, 30, 5354]], [[6, 17747, 5841, 198682, 596, 12, 77, 4736, 6, 0, 13789, 1801, 33, 181, 73, 48, 921, 3], [10, 880, 130, 14367, 17, 17653, 189, 30, 7, 23321, 14367], [1140, 7, 23321, 14605, 52, 3540, 55, 23783], [212, 77, 23321, 14367, 33, 91, 48, 23783], [37, 1702, 39, 4702, 30, 23321, 113, 7, 4736, 30, 6931, 21, 0, 30355, 3, 17653, 34, 39, 30, 36, 1973, 23321, 900], [198682, 580, 7, 14367, 117, 37, 17, 7, 494, 30355, 3, 23783, 7, 29897], [4, 169, 0, 311, 3, 0, 29897, 53, 662, 22, 197, 109, 17653, 5, 23783, 20, 33, 6, 47, 14605, 5, 1679, 37, 4, 0, 311, 3, 0, 4736], [100, 7, 23321, 14367, 17, 55, 17653, 5, 48, 23783, 30, 580, 5, 7, 4136, 14367, 17, 228, 17653, 5, 228, 23783, 30, 580], [212, 61, 18, 281809, 26, 2314, 198682, 86, 36, 30, 1192, 23783, 1403, 3604], [4, 2827, 39, 30, 567, 13643, 870, 34968, 5, 7, 145, 3, 68, 1210, 0, 1329], [], [0, 1329, 45322, 1403, 1769, 0, 1329, 5, 2555, 3, 1426, 14367], [21, 88, 37, 34968, 2827, 12, 4, 1530, 10, 64, 0, 2555, 3, 0, 14367, 23783, 390, 3604]], [[6, 514, 17747, 9639, 15157, 399, 0, 899, 4, 1210, 490, 31579, 6, 7, 4186], [18, 6314, 37, 21, 1019, 61, 18, 30, 4088, 23783, 22, 7, 4100, 14367, 824, 4, 1210, 7, 50], [212, 18, 3995, 12, 773, 3, 7, 50, 29897, 0, 4100, 1481, 511, 75, 7, 57405, 14367, 7, 357, 14367, 73, 4100], [1896, 15157, 33, 1129, 0, 4100, 14367], [37, 30, 0, 85, 384, 490, 31579, 2614], [37, 3358, 1181, 410, 4, 0, 2675, 3, 0, 4065, 1211]], [[489, 75, 0, 589, 13643, 242, 1479, 75, 0, 5351, 3, 0, 14367], [622, 12886, 21735, 39, 6314, 12, 17653, 5, 23783, 30, 1403, 159, 3, 68, 12886, 580, 42344]], [[0, 181, 5697, 1423, 100, 372, 326, 25, 0, 56705, 8712], [56705, 4223, 12, 0, 13278, 3604, 6, 7, 6237, 204, 0, 14605, 580, 0, 13278, 6237], [6, 0, 13278, 6237, 20, 30, 3173, 4, 346, 2796, 111, 13278, 30], [0, 56705, 8712, 30, 234, 4, 596, 66, 111, 7, 13278, 30, 647, 4, 30], [37, 237, 30, 580, 0, 13278, 15226]]]}, {"title": "Structure and parts", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Parts", "text": "The complex atom is made up of three main particles; the proton, the neutron and the electron.

Its name comes from the word ''glue'' as gluons act like atomic glue, sticking the protons together using the ''strong nuclear force''. It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons.\n\n\n\nThe number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through radioactive decay.

This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together<ref name=Splung></ref> or has too many protons or neutrons. When this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles. It does this through radiation. An atom that does this can be called ''radioactive''. Unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass/particles that they become stable. All atoms above atomic number 82 (82 protons, lead) are radioactive.<ref name=Splung />\n\nThere are three main types of radioactive decay; alpha, beta and gamma.<ref></ref>\n\n* Alpha decay is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons. This is essentially a helium nucleus. The result is an element with atomic number two less than before. So for example if a beryllium atom (atomic number 4) went through alpha decay it would become helium (atomic number 2). Alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass.\n* Beta decay is when a neutron turns into a proton or a proton turns into a neutron. In the first case the atom shoots out an electron. In the second case it is a positron (like an electron but with a positive charge). The end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before. Beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons, or too many neutrons.\n* Gamma decay is when an atom shoots out a gamma ray, or wave. It happens when there is a change in the energy of the nucleus. This is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay. There is no change in the mass, or atomic number or the atom, only in the stored energy inside the nucleus.\n\nEvery radioactive element or isotope has what is named a ''half-life''. This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element.<ref></ref> Large atoms, or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life, because they must lose more neutrons to become stable.\n\nMarie Curie discovered the first form of radiation. She found the element and named it radium. She was also the first female recipient of the Nobel Prize.\n\nFrederick Soddy conducted an experiment to observe what happens as radium decays. He placed a sample in a light bulb and waited for it to decay. Suddenly, helium (containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons) appeared in the bulb, and from this experiment he discovered this type of radiation has a positive charge.\n\nJames Chadwick discovered the neutron, by observing decay products of different types of radioactive isotopes. Chadwick noticed that the atomic number of the elements was lower than the total atomic mass of the atom. He concluded that electrons could not be the cause of the extra mass because they barely have mass.\n\nEnrico Fermi, used the neutrons to shoot them at uranium. He discovered that uranium decayed a lot faster than usual and produced a lot of alpha and beta particles. He also believed that uranium got changed into a new element he named hesperium.\n\nOtto Hanh and Fritz Strassmann repeated Fermi's experiment to see if the new element hesperium was actually created. They discovered two new things Fermi did not observe. By using a lot of neutrons the nucleus of the atom would split, producing a lot of heat energy. Also the fission products of uranium were already discovered: thorium, palladium, radium, radon and lead.\n\nFermi then noticed that the fission of one uranium atom shot off more neutrons, which then split other atoms, creating chain reactions. He realised that this process is called nuclear fission and could create huge amounts of heat energy.\n\nThat very discovery of Fermi's led to the development of the first nuclear bomb code-named 'Trinity'.", "paragraphs": [[[77, 4736, 5, 109, 29897, 33, 102, 30, 580, 7, 11178, 14605], [37, 1702, 0, 14605, 30, 900, 317, 365, 4, 802, 1003, 600, 29126, 311], [46, 33, 317, 109, 17653, 46, 23783], [61, 37, 1927, 0, 14605, 33, 4, 169, 6642, 3, 0, 6572, 1329, 46, 12886], [20, 14219, 37, 131, 6478], [29, 14367, 12, 14219, 37, 86, 30, 580, 9958], [11178, 14367, 660, 4, 30, 9958, 207, 39, 1895, 575, 1329, 12886, 12, 39, 399, 3328], [64, 14367, 1069, 4065, 30355, 17653, 410, 30, 311], []], [[63, 30, 87, 444, 1554, 3, 9958, 14382, 8546, 10079, 5]], [[], [8546, 14382, 30, 61, 0, 14367, 4088, 66, 7, 12886, 33, 55, 17653, 5, 55, 23783], [37, 30, 4655, 7, 23321, 14605], [0, 712, 30, 7, 4736, 17, 4065, 30355, 55, 333, 73, 106], [100, 10, 880, 83, 7, 53779, 14367, 4065, 30355, 242, 131, 8546, 14382, 20, 54, 399, 23321, 4065, 30355], [8546, 14382, 1927, 61, 7, 14367, 30, 317, 365, 5, 408, 4, 169, 6642, 3, 77, 1329], [], [10079, 14382, 30, 61, 7, 23783, 890, 75, 7, 17653, 46, 7, 17653, 890, 75, 7, 23783], [6, 0, 305, 0, 14367, 4088, 66, 7, 13278], [6, 0, 232, 305, 20, 30, 7, 67489, 117, 7, 13278, 34, 17, 7, 1335, 1090], [0, 156, 712, 30, 7, 4736, 17, 48, 152, 46, 48, 653, 4065, 30355, 73, 106], [10079, 14382, 1927, 61, 7, 14367, 33, 900, 317, 109, 17653, 46, 317, 109, 23783], [17304, 14382, 30, 61, 7, 14367, 4088, 66, 7, 17304, 3014, 46, 2686], [20, 1927, 61, 63, 30, 7, 511, 6, 0, 634, 3, 0, 14605], [37, 30, 1140, 49, 7, 14605, 33, 411, 242, 131, 8546, 46, 10079, 14382], [63, 30, 84, 511, 6, 0, 1329, 46, 4065, 30355, 46, 0, 14367, 91, 6, 0, 1612, 634, 1038, 0, 14605]], [[359, 9958, 4736, 46, 29897, 33, 102, 30, 311, 7, 343, 214], [37, 30, 197, 173, 20, 190, 343, 3, 130, 5863, 3, 14367, 3, 12, 1554, 4, 14382, 207, 39, 399, 7, 494, 3328, 29897, 46, 426, 14367, 46, 29897, 17, 7, 365, 2333, 118, 0, 30355, 3, 17653, 5, 23783, 43, 2317, 33, 7, 173, 343, 214, 113, 39, 390, 1895, 181, 23783, 4, 399, 3328]], [[5404, 48162, 6314, 0, 683, 3, 6478], [67, 596, 0, 4736, 5, 311, 20, 51570], [67, 30, 52, 0, 1632, 8082, 3, 0, 4484, 1936]], [[5841, 198682, 2627, 7, 5943, 4, 8587, 102, 1927, 7, 51570, 14382], [18, 241, 7, 5863, 6, 7, 897, 20388, 5, 2472, 10, 20, 4, 14382], [3709, 23321, 3540, 17653, 5, 23783, 1650, 6, 0, 20388, 5, 25, 37, 5943, 18, 6314, 37, 1554, 3, 6478, 33, 7, 1335, 1090]], [[870, 34968, 6314, 0, 23783, 21, 8587, 14382, 1459, 3, 494, 1554, 3, 9958, 29897], [34968, 3995, 12, 0, 4065, 30355, 3, 0, 4736, 30, 653, 73, 0, 477, 4065, 1329, 3, 0, 14367], [18, 7630, 12, 13278, 86, 36, 30, 0, 1157, 3, 0, 2004, 1329, 113, 39, 4236, 33, 1329]], [[22089, 43663, 234, 0, 23783, 4, 4088, 101, 22, 4100], [18, 6314, 12, 4100, 14382, 7, 530, 1605, 73, 3518, 5, 1711, 7, 530, 3, 8546, 5, 10079, 12886], [18, 52, 733, 12, 4100, 169, 511, 75, 7, 50, 4736, 18, 311]], [[9639, 69600, 5, 14276, 261221, 5148, 43663, 5943, 4, 253, 83, 0, 50, 4736, 30, 1403, 1210], [39, 6314, 55, 50, 873, 43663, 88, 36, 8587], [21, 234, 7, 530, 3, 23783, 0, 14605, 3, 0, 14367, 54, 2288, 1711, 7, 530, 3, 1965, 634], [52, 0, 31579, 1459, 3, 4100, 30, 411, 6314, 63584, 22067, 51570, 46554, 5, 410]], [[43663, 127, 3995, 12, 0, 31579, 3, 48, 4100, 14367, 4088, 138, 181, 23783, 42, 127, 2288, 68, 14367, 1210, 2853, 2614], [18, 17635, 12, 37, 546, 30, 580, 490, 31579, 5, 86, 1210, 1324, 1418, 3, 1965, 634]], [[12, 191, 3358, 3, 43663, 410, 4, 0, 380, 3, 0, 490, 1211, 2280, 311, 8297]]]}, {"title": "References", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Other websites", "text": "* General information on atomic structure\n* Atomic structure timeline\n* Atom (science) -Citizendium", "paragraphs": [[[], [216, 419, 13, 4065, 1972], [4065, 1972, 11529], [14367, 1121]]]}]}

Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to ''observe'' or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to explain the observations and predict what might happen. The two aspects of the science may work together: the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works. However, the main product of astronomy is to explain puzzling features of the universe. For almost a hundred years the most important issue has been to explain the expansion of the universe (see red shift and Hubble's law).", "paragraphs": [[[13905], [25, 0, 1622, 176637], [1702, 753, 5, 177869, 1702, 264, 30, 0, 2440, 806, 3, 19228, 719]], [[0, 4599, 806, 488, 753, 8403, 4090, 3377, 11091, 14805, 5, 32775], [14530, 587, 0, 1828, 3904, 30, 52, 806], [12, 488, 33836, 2421, 17304, 3014, 6305, 5, 15438, 15181, 2093, 6478], [13905, 1310, 0, 380, 106166, 6422, 23084, 5, 926, 3, 19228, 719, 7, 219, 7, 0, 1972, 5, 380, 3, 0, 5187]], [[13905, 30, 48, 3, 0, 167, 1121], [2359, 69, 234, 0, 704, 3, 0, 753, 4, 16107, 5, 4, 596, 61, 30, 0, 143, 79, 4, 1189, 5413], [13905, 30, 191, 793, 4, 35766], [7, 11089, 1698, 33770, 30, 1310, 17, 806, 0, 5187, 7, 7, 5, 0, 179, 0, 5187, 511, 74, 79], [13905, 30, 36, 0, 215, 7, 29593, 0, 4440, 12, 0, 4467, 0, 753, 5, 0, 4090, 107, 3194, 473, 682]], [[108, 0, 589, 63, 33, 30, 55, 444, 1554, 3, 13905, 40847, 5, 10340, 13905], [40847, 13905, 234, 10944, 5, 3534, 4, 8587, 46, 662, 22, 753, 8403, 5, 68, 14363, 4599], [10340, 13905, 234, 7460, 5, 951, 1423, 4, 3392, 0, 7337, 5, 6326, 102, 107, 1927], [0, 55, 6395, 3, 0, 1121, 107, 161, 600, 0, 10340, 6326, 102, 189, 1927, 5, 0, 40847, 273, 401, 0, 11231, 161], [212, 0, 444, 1459, 3, 13905, 30, 4, 3392, 12268, 2047, 3, 0, 5187], [10, 591, 7, 3079, 62, 0, 181, 481, 495, 33, 30, 4, 3392, 0, 2346, 3, 0, 5187, 253, 639, 3251, 5, 17852, 264]]]}, {"title": "History of astronomy", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Ancient", "text": "Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars.

The existence of other galaxies was settled by Edwin Hubble, who identified the Andromeda nebula as a different galaxy. It was also Hubble who proved that the universe was expanding. There were many other galaxies at large distances and they are receding, moving away from our galaxy. That was completely unexpected.\n\nIn 1931, Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications, marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky. Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy, allowing more discoveries to be made.\n\nThe opening of this new window on the Universe saw the discovery of entirely new things, for example pulsars, which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space. The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source.\n\nThe period after World War 2 saw more observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites, normally by governments. For example, Bernard Lovell began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military radar equipment. By 1957, the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world. Similarly, the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at Mauna Kea in Hawaii, a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies.\n\nThe next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry.  This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites.\n\nSpace telescopes gave access, for the first time in history, to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere.  The X-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet light and parts of the infra-red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched.  As with other parts of the spectrum, new discoveries were made.\n\nFrom 1970s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites, causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 589, 49, 253, 481, 511, 6, 13905]], [[6, 0, 199, 20, 1092, 4, 30, 1863, 12, 0, 8403, 6, 42, 53, 682, 0, 25293, 179, 30, 36, 0, 91, 8403], [0, 3794, 3, 68, 8403, 30, 3622, 21, 10729, 17852, 38, 3559, 0, 43719, 32775, 7, 7, 494, 8403], [20, 30, 52, 17852, 38, 2827, 12, 0, 5187, 30, 2786], [63, 30, 109, 68, 8403, 22, 426, 2296, 5, 39, 30, 33850, 483, 420, 25, 162, 8403], [12, 30, 2215, 6000]], [[6, 5041, 200364, 6314, 681, 12153, 25, 587, 0, 1828, 61, 841, 4, 13179, 7, 1173, 3, 6056, 6, 681, 3572, 799, 0, 2607, 3, 681, 13905, 5, 0, 1266, 22, 234, 170, 153, 3, 0, 19479, 7172, 4, 8587, 0, 3505], [155, 153, 3, 0, 19479, 7172, 12, 0, 3904, 88, 36, 1963, 30, 114, 310, 60, 4, 13905, 949, 181, 3358, 4, 30, 159]], [[0, 310, 3, 37, 50, 3453, 13, 0, 5187, 253, 0, 3358, 3, 3462, 50, 873, 10, 880, 58493, 42, 1545, 1385, 12700, 3, 681, 2686, 66, 75, 863], [0, 2686, 30, 269, 4, 30, 8334, 6, 3600, 113, 0, 12700, 30, 100, 1385, 12, 20, 16881, 7, 6705, 1173]], [[0, 566, 49, 85, 136, 253, 181, 8890, 111, 426, 5, 5697, 10944, 30, 1190, 5, 3189, 22, 219, 8587, 576, 3520, 21, 78], [10, 880, 4976, 32094, 1092, 681, 13905, 22, 123149, 231, 234, 24770, 178, 5366, 1404], [21, 0, 576, 33, 0, 426, 109534, 681, 10944, 6, 0, 85], [5534, 0, 156, 3, 0, 253, 0, 465, 3, 0, 1190, 3, 21853, 8890, 22, 55636, 57265, 6, 5112, 7, 219, 576, 10, 4801, 5, 73681, 639, 10944, 5551, 4, 47, 152, 7383, 5, 706, 3505]], [[0, 182, 353, 2525, 6, 13905, 30, 5551, 4, 0, 2607, 3, 75913], [37, 949, 10944, 4, 30, 241, 6, 863, 13, 2805]], [[863, 10944, 455, 1122, 10, 0, 79, 6, 299, 4, 0, 1452, 19479, 7172, 488, 3014, 12, 33, 30, 1963, 21, 0, 3904], [0, 1585, 3014, 17304, 3014, 23081, 897, 5, 153, 3, 0, 73681, 639, 7172, 30, 64, 310, 4, 13905, 7, 8587, 10944, 30, 1783], [19, 17, 68, 153, 3, 0, 7172, 50, 3358, 30, 159]], [[25, 2805, 30, 1783, 4, 30, 2451, 17, 181, 5697, 5, 143, 2805, 1157, 0, 3505, 4, 30, 3464, 6, 573, 64, 153, 3, 0, 19479, 7172]]]}, {"title": "Discoveries", "text": "Discoveries broadly come in two types:  bodies and phenomena.

For safety, they were often close together. Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures, like the Great Pyramids of Giza. The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call \"Classical Architecture\". The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the arch from the Etruscans, who copied it from the Mesopotamians. The stone columns, which still hold up so many important buildings, like the Parthenon in Athens, were simply copied from the first wooden posts.\n\n\n'''Classical Architecture''' was very formal, and it always obeyed laws. It used symmetry, which really means balance, and it used proportion which means keeping shapes in certain ways. The Golden Mean was a rule (or law) which said, (to put it very simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times as long as the short side. There are many laws in Classical Architecture, like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago.\n\nIn some parts of the world, like India, the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles were made in China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America.\n\nLater, people in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture, then Gothic architecture.  Gothic buildings have tall, pointed windows and arches.  Many churches have Gothic architecture. Castles were also built at this time. In Eastern Europe, churches usually had domes. People added their own ideas and decoration to the Classical Architecture of the past.  The Renaissance brought a return to classical ideas. \n\nIn the late 18th century with the Industrial Revolution, people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many factories and mills were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the Victorian era, architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller.  For example, the cathedral in Ulm, Germany is over 500 feet tall.  However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse.  This happened to the Beauvais Cathedral, which was never completed. \n\n\nTowards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, steel became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build. An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them skyscrapers. This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings.\n\nModernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890.

It is like a planet but smaller. They range from very small (smaller than a car) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. A few asteroids have asteroid moon.\n\nThe name \"asteroid\" means \"like a star\" in the ancient Greek language. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the Sun, while stars only seem to move because the Earth spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own light. Because of this, some people think \"asteroids\" is not a good name, and think that the name \"planetoid\" (\"like a planet\") would be a better name.\n\nGiuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. He called it Ceres, and it is the biggest object in the asteroid belt. Others, like Juno, Pallas, and Vesta were found later. In the 1850s so many had been found, that they were numbered by a Minor planet designation starting with 1 Ceres. Today, astronomers using computerized telescopes find thousands of asteroids every month. Asteroid impact prediction is one of the purposes.  \n\nAsteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the Solar System. These rocks were too small to come together to make a planet. Some are made of carbon or metal. Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various asteroid spectral types including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon).\n\nMost asteroids in our Solar System are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called Near-Earth asteroids.

Mahmud of Ghazni, a great Ghaznavid sultan, conquered the Multan and Punjab region, and carried raids into the heart of India. Mohammed bin Abdul Jabbar Utbi (Al-Utbi), a historian from the 10th century, wrote that thousands of \"Afghans\" were in the Ghaznavid army.<ref name=\"Houtsma\"></ref><ref name=\"Habibi\"></ref> The Ghaznavid dynasty was replaced by the Ghorids of Ghor in the late 12th century, who reconquered Ghaznavid territory in the name of Islam and ruled it until 1206.

The New Persian literature arose and flourished in the area. The early Persian poets such as Rudaki were from what is now Afghanistan. Moreover, Ferdowsi, the author of Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, and Rumi, the famous Sufi poet, were also from modern-day Afghanistan. It has produced scientists such as Avicenna, Al-Farabi, Al-Biruni, Omar Khayy\u00e1m, Al-Khwarizmi, and many others who are widely known for their important contributions in areas such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, physics, geography, and geology. It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating Mongol invasion in the 13th century.<ref>Lorentz, J. Historical Dictionary of Iran. 1995  AFGHANISTAN</ref>\n\nTimur, the Turkic conqueror, took over in the end of the 14th century and began to rebuild cities in this region. Timur's successors, the Timurids (1405\u20131507), were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of Herat with fine buildings. Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity.\n\nBetween south of the Hindu Kush and the Indus River (today's Pakistan) was the native land of the Afghan tribes. They called this land \"Afghanistan\" (meaning \"land of the Afghans\"). The Afghans ruled the rich northern Indian subcontinent with their capital at Delhi. From the 16th to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was disputed between the Safavids of Isfahan and the Mughals of Agra who had replaced the Lodi and Suri Afghan rulers in India. The Safavids and Mughals occasionally oppressed the native Afghans but at the same time the Afghans used each empire to punish the other. In 1709, the Hotaki Afghans rose to power and completely defeated the Persian Empire. Then they marched towards the Mughals of India and nominally defeated them with the help of the Afsharid forces under Nader Shah Afshar.\n\nIn 1747, after Nader Shah of Persia was killed, a great leader named Ahmad Shah Durrani united all the different Muslim tribes and established the Afghan Empire (Durrani Empire). He is considered the founding father of the modern state of Afghanistan<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> while Mirwais Hotak is the grandfather of the nation.", "paragraphs": [[[1093, 5354, 3090, 6, 0, 589, 5, 3892, 1092, 1635, 0, 50, 2830], [6, 0, 5, 589, 109, 250, 959, 5037, 1027, 4, 268, 1038, 860], [48, 3, 0, 199, 30, 0, 398144, 507, 1859, 488, 60580, 5, 19292, 39, 2617, 1372, 25, 0, 93557, 6], [0, 398144, 30, 4372, 6, 59, 21, 0, 254072, 3, 148042, 6, 556, 860], [250, 1781, 6, 0, 193, 720, 399, 144414, 3, 0, 1528, 159623, 38, 1067, 25, 55579], [25, 4, 193, 3, 0, 5021, 40609, 6, 860, 3710, 7, 2410, 464, 124, 131370], [], [52644, 34481], [48235, 34481, 5120, 2978, 8311], [1147], [52644, 34481]], [[6, 0, 589, 0, 250, 164381, 890, 27087, 75, 44, 351, 5, 6509, 2617, 3090, 983, 64, 237, 3, 860, 2077, 0, 260986, 368, 6, 0, 2592], [10276, 3, 27087, 7, 353, 146415, 7267, 16461, 0, 29295, 5, 9130, 368, 5, 1619, 3333, 75, 0, 1058, 3, 474], [3144, 2305, 4112, 29192, 318, 7, 5063, 25, 0, 589, 2432, 12, 4119, 3, 1743, 30, 6, 0, 146415], [], [], [0, 146415, 5037, 30, 2451, 21, 0, 3, 82372, 6, 0, 288, 589, 38, 91471, 146415, 1456, 6, 0, 311, 3, 3090, 5, 1067, 20, 207], [0, 330, 52, 488, 1415]], [[860, 30, 3807, 7], [21875, 1702, 607, 3, 0, 1027, 1662, 42, 30, 7, 9834, 5, 920, 8170, 368, 1022, 7, 372, 7, 0, 29392], []], [[64, 0, 224, 115, 3, 1194, 860, 30, 313, 3, 1121, 5, 1295, 6, 0, 341], [0, 50, 5727, 3290, 10852, 5, 15962, 6, 0, 237], [0, 199, 5727, 4819, 125, 7, 267565, 30, 25, 102, 30, 114, 860], [5823, 109890, 0, 1715, 3, 118091, 0, 121, 7595, 3, 545, 5, 61266, 0, 1613, 23267, 4819, 30, 52, 25, 1194, 122, 860], [20, 33, 1711, 4756, 125, 7, 81338, 318, 268622, 318, 212179, 5207, 210118, 318, 5, 109, 68, 38, 30, 1799, 346, 10, 44, 481, 4235, 6, 237, 125, 7, 6510, 13905, 2350, 106166, 4213, 5, 13344], [20, 944, 0, 1704, 351, 3, 20499, 207, 0, 38416, 22237, 2650, 6, 0], [], [], [41634, 2245, 10321, 3, 545], [], []], [[37053, 0, 26051, 27987, 190, 74, 6, 0, 156, 3, 0, 589, 5, 1092, 4, 6013, 115, 6, 37, 368], [37053, 3931, 0, 190766, 30, 353, 9600, 3, 2368, 5, 0, 760, 38, 15581, 44, 351, 115, 3, 19292, 17, 1695, 447], [124, 44, 1067, 860, 3710, 349, 5, 6208]], [[118, 139, 3, 0, 5021, 40609, 5, 0, 29392, 620, 373, 656, 30, 0, 1683, 607, 3, 0, 1743, 5119], [39, 580, 37, 607, 860, 1702, 607, 3, 0, 1743], [0, 1743, 1067, 0, 1727, 529, 792, 20056, 17, 44, 351, 22, 3938], [25, 0, 4, 0, 199, 589, 860, 30, 2074, 118, 0, 120920, 3, 27589, 5, 0, 51922, 3, 31097, 38, 33, 2451, 0, 34391, 5, 46633, 1743, 7154, 6, 474], [0, 120920, 5, 51922, 4476, 65259, 0, 1683, 1743, 34, 22, 0, 215, 79, 0, 1743, 234, 236, 2552, 4, 7978, 0, 68], [6, 0, 237418, 1743, 1027, 4, 268, 5, 2215, 1841, 0, 5727, 2552], [127, 39, 304, 1811, 0, 51922, 3, 474, 5, 21984, 1841, 101, 17, 0, 275, 3, 0, 324666, 352, 124, 12758, 4954, 80499]], [[6, 49, 12758, 4954, 3, 20499, 30, 1916, 7, 353, 329, 311, 5899, 4954, 44378, 8970, 64, 0, 494, 1172, 5119, 5, 2617, 0, 1743, 2552, 44378, 2552], [18, 30, 1568, 0, 238, 629, 3, 0, 1194, 92, 3, 860, 29126, 110, 71961, 126456, 30, 0, 6155, 3, 0, 513]]]}, {"title": "Recent history", "text": "During the 1800s, Afghanistan became a buffer zone between two powerful empires, British India and Russia. As British India advanced into Afghanistan, Russia felt threatened and expanded southward across Central Asia. To stop the Russian advance, Britain tried to make Afghanistan part of its empire but the Afghans fought wars with British-led Indians from 1839 to 1842 and from 1878 to 1880. After the third war in 1919, Afghanistan under King Amanullah gained respect and recognition as a completely independent state.\n\nThe Kingdom of Afghanistan was a constitutional monarchy established in 1926. It was the successor state to the Emirate of Afghanistan. On 27 September 1934, during the reign of Zahir Shah, the Kingdom of Afghanistan joined the League of Nations.  During World War II, Afghanistan remained neutral. It pursued a diplomatic policy of non-alignment.\n\nThe creation of Pakistan in 1947 as its eastern neighbor created problems. In 1973, political crises led to the overthrow of the king. The country's new leader ended the monarchy and made Afghanistan a republic. In 1978, a Communist political party supported by the Soviet Union seized control of Afghanistan's government. This move sparked rebellions throughout the country. The government asked the Soviet Union for military assistance. The Soviets took advantage of the situation and invaded Afghanistan in December 1979.\n\nMost people in Afghanistan opposed the sudden Soviet presence in their country. For nearly a decade, anti-Communist Islamic forces known as ''Mujahideen'' were trained inside neighboring Pakistan to fight the Soviets and the Afghan government. The United States and other anti-Soviet countries supported the Mujahideen. In the long war, over one million Afghan civilians were killed. The Soviet Army also lost more than 15,000 soldiers in that war. Millions of Afghans left their country to stay safe in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. In 1989 the Soviet Army withdrew the last of its troops.\n\nAfter the Soviets left, different Afghan warlords began fighting for control of the country. The warlords received support from other countries, including neighboring Pakistan and Iran. A very conservative Islamic group known as the Taliban emerged in an attempt to end the civil war. By the late 1990s the Taliban had gained control over 95% of Afghanistan. A group known as the Northern Alliance, based in northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan, continued to fight against the Taliban.\n\n\nThe Taliban ruled Afghanistan according to their strict version of Islamic law. People whom the Taliban believed violated these laws were given cruel punishments. In addition, the Taliban completely restricted the rights of women. Because of such policies, most countries refused to recognize the Taliban government. Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) accepted them as the official government.\n\nThe Taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected terrorists to live freely in Afghanistan. Among them were Osama bin Laden and members of the al-Qaeda terrorist network. In September 2001, the United States blamed bin Laden for the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C. The Taliban refused to hand him over to the United States. In response, the United States and its allies launched a bombing campaign against al-Qaeda in October 2001. Within months the Taliban abandoned Kabul, and a new government led by Hamid Karzai came to power, but fighting between the Taliban and US-led armies continued.  Taliban fighters have gone into Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan.  Afghans accuse Pakistan's military of being behind the Taliban militants but Pakistan has rejected this and stated that a stable Afghanistan is in Pakistan's own interest.\n\nIn December 2004, Hamid Karzai became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan.<ref name=cia/> NATO began rebuilding Afghanistan, including its military and government institutions.  Many schools and colleges were built.  Freedom for women has improved. Women can study, work, drive, and run for office.

In the Americas (South and North), Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order).\n\nThe oldest signs of people in Argentina are in the Patagonia (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old. In 1480 the Inca Empire conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the Guaran\u00ed developed a culture based on yuca and sweet potato however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef.\n\nOther languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentinians are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent.\n\nArgentina declared independent from Spain in 1816, and achieved it in a War led by Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn in 1818. Many immigrants from Europe came to the country. By the 1920s it was the 7th wealthiest country in the world, but it began a decline after this. In the 1940s, following the \"infamous decade\" where the country's politics were not stable, Juan Peron came to power. Peron was one of the most important people in the country's history and many politicians today call themselves Peronist. Peron was forced out of power in 1955. After spending years in exile he returned to power in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1976, the country was falling into chaos, and the military took power. This was not the first time the military had done this. Leading the new government was Jorge Rafael Videla. Videla was one of history's most brutal dictators. Thousands of people disappeared or were killed during his time as president. Videla retired in 1980.\n\nOne of his successors was another general turned dictator, Leopoldo Galtieri. By the time Galtieri was in office in 1981 the dictatorship became unpopular. To stir up support, Galtieri ordered an invasion of the Falkland Islands, starting the Falklands War.  Argentina lost the war, and soon the country fell into chaos again.

It has an ancient cultural heritage. Urartu was established in 860 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the Satrapy of Armenia.

By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the Russian Empire, while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule. \n\nDuring World War I, Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, all non-Russian countries declared their independence after the Russian Empire ceased to exist, leading to the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, and in 1922 became a founding member of the Soviet Union. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, into full Union republics. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Republic of Armenia recognises the Armenian Apostolic Church, the world's oldest national church, as the country's primary religious establishment.<ref>The republic has separation of church and state</ref><ref></ref> The unique Armenian alphabet was invented by Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD.\n\nArmenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, the Council of Europe and the Collective Security Treaty Organization.

An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down (turning into a lighter element, for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay). A chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements. In a compound, two or more atoms are joined together to form a molecule. The tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid, that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules. Mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted. An example would be mixing sand and salt. This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately. Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction. An example would be heating sodium bicarbonate, common baking soda. It will make water, carbon dioxide, and sodium carbonate. This reaction cannot be undone.\n\nOne very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions.  For example, two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule, H<sub>2</sub>O.  This relationship is known as the \"Law of constant proportions\" and leads to the idea of \"stoichiometry\", a term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds.  For example, in water, there are always exactly 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 oxygen atom.  In carbon dioxide, there are exactly 2 oxygen atoms for 1 carbon atom.

{"title": "Computer", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "A '''computer''' is a machine that accepts data as input, process that data using programs, and output the processed data. Many computers can store and retrieve information using hard drives. Computers can be connected together to form networks, allowing connected computers to communicate with each other.\n\nThe two principal characteristics of a computer are: It responds to a specific instruction set in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program). There are four main processing steps in a computer: inputting, storage, outputting and processing.\n\nModern computers can do billions of calculations per second. Computers do many different jobs where automation is useful. Some examples are controlling traffic lights, vehicle computers, security systems, washing machines and digital televisions.\n\nComputers can be designed to do almost anything with information. Computers are used to control large and small machines which in the past were controlled by humans. Most people have used a personal computer in their home or at work. They are used for things such as listening to music, reading the news and writing.\n\nModern computers are electronic computer hardware. They do mathematical arithmetic very quickly but computers do not really \"think\". They only follow the instructions in their software programs. The software uses the hardware when the user gives it instructions, and gives useful output.\n\nHumans control computers with user interfaces. Input devices include keyboards, computer mice, buttons, and touch screens. Some computers can also be controlled with voice commands, hand gestures or even brain signals through electrodes implanted in the brain or along nerves.\n\nComputer program<nowiki/>s are designed or written by computer programmer<nowiki/>s. A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language called machine code. Most programs are written using a programming language like C++, Java, and Fortran. These programming languages are more like the language with which one talks and writes every day. The compiler translates the user's instructions into binary code (machine code) that the computer will understand and do what is needed.", "paragraphs": [[[7, 951, 30, 7, 2358, 12, 1863, 64168, 7, 8060, 546, 12, 64168, 234, 371, 5, 2756, 0, 546, 64168], [109, 951, 86, 1612, 5, 12879, 419, 234, 605, 1203], [2802, 86, 30, 6481, 600, 4, 683, 849, 949, 6481, 951, 4, 8231, 17, 236, 68]], [[0, 55, 2965, 8853, 3, 7, 951, 30, 20, 3360, 4, 7, 1902, 7706, 208, 6, 7, 219, 6931, 3977, 5, 20, 86, 11389, 7, 674, 3, 7706, 7, 371], [63, 30, 133, 444, 546, 1065, 6, 7, 951, 8060, 4418, 2756, 5, 546]], [[1194, 951, 86, 88, 160, 3, 14195, 532, 232], [2802, 88, 109, 494, 664, 111, 19153, 30, 4699], [77, 880, 30, 424, 1596, 897, 1907, 951, 194, 278, 9034, 2358, 5, 2150, 458]], [[2802, 86, 30, 1252, 4, 88, 591, 1096, 17, 419], [2802, 30, 234, 4, 424, 426, 5, 357, 2358, 42, 6, 0, 341, 30, 424, 21, 473], [96, 69, 33, 234, 7, 894, 951, 6, 44, 163, 46, 22, 161], [39, 30, 234, 10, 873, 125, 7, 4927, 4, 403, 1465, 0, 172, 5, 2432]], [[1194, 951, 30, 2505, 951, 6168], [39, 88, 9359, 21613, 191, 1177, 34, 951, 88, 36, 588, 269], [39, 91, 1816, 0, 7706, 6, 44, 1516, 371], [0, 1516, 234, 0, 6168, 61, 0, 4832, 455, 20, 7706, 5, 455, 4699, 2756]], [[3790, 424, 951, 17, 4832, 9630], [8060, 3272, 488, 10266, 951, 7571, 6910, 5, 3255, 2491], [77, 951, 86, 52, 30, 424, 17, 1713, 1625, 823, 7536, 46, 151, 2955, 3248, 131, 35240, 21788, 6, 0, 2955, 46, 385, 7263]], [[951, 371, 30, 1252, 46, 2432, 21, 951, 19226], [7, 306, 19226, 2432, 371, 6, 0, 951, 261, 1032, 580, 2358, 2280], [96, 371, 30, 2432, 234, 7, 2914, 1032, 117, 7459, 5, 57778], [158, 2914, 1032, 30, 181, 117, 0, 1032, 17, 42, 48, 1077, 5, 2432, 359, 122], [0, 27634, 10994, 0, 4832, 7706, 75, 17011, 2280, 2358, 2280, 12, 0, 951, 43, 1906, 5, 88, 102, 30, 408]]]}, {"title": "History of computers", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Automation", "text": "Most humans have a problem with math.

In 1623, Wilhelm Schickard made a mechanical calculator.  Other Europeans made more calculators after him.  They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris. Because of this, we say they were not programmable. Now engineers use computers to design and plan.\n\nIn 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted.  This means the loom was programmable.\n\nCharles Babbage wanted to make a similar machine that could calculate.   He called it \"The Analytical Engine\".<ref>Don't confuse the Analytical Engine with Babbage's difference engine which was a non-programmable mechanical calculator.</ref> Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea, he never built his Analytical Engine.\n\nAs time went on, computers were used more.  People get bored easily doing the same thing over and over.  Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards, storing them, and then having to go find them again.  The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that.  It was expensive, and reports took a long time.  Then an engineer worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work.  Herman Hollerith invented a tabulating machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected.  The Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation (which later became IBM) made his machines.  They leased the machines instead of selling them.  Makers of machines had long helped their users understand and repair them, and CTR's tech support was especially good.\n\nBecause of machines like this, new ways of talking to these machines were invented, and new types of machines were invented, and eventually the computer as we know it was born.", "paragraphs": [[[22, 0, 156, 3, 0, 699, 3875, 69, 465, 269, 7460, 5, 3939, 30, 181, 481], [6, 11454, 159, 7, 6331, 28324], [68, 291, 159, 181, 28324, 49, 103], [39, 30, 36, 1194, 951, 113, 39, 86, 91, 1679, 45903, 5], [81, 86, 36, 511, 102, 39, 88, 4, 159, 101, 88, 645, 117, 282, 63724], [113, 3, 37, 53, 203, 39, 30, 36, 41591], [114, 3939, 234, 951, 4, 1252, 5, 394]], [[6, 1969, 5404, 98055, 234, 7849, 1307, 1904, 4, 1361, 26, 7108, 21272, 102, 921, 3, 4467, 4, 26186], [18, 86, 234, 7849, 1904, 4, 1361, 0, 21272, 102, 4, 88, 5, 18, 86, 511, 0, 7849, 1904, 42, 1702, 18, 86, 371, 0, 21272, 4, 26186, 0, 4467, 18, 303], [37, 1702, 0, 21272, 30, 41591]], [[1301, 80057, 303, 4, 159, 7, 793, 2358, 12, 86, 14113], [18, 580, 20, 0, 16767], [20436, 0, 16767, 2100, 17, 80057, 2333, 2100, 42, 30, 7, 1337, 41591, 6331], [113, 80057, 88, 36, 33, 575, 308, 5, 690, 511, 26, 1252, 61, 18, 33, 7, 143, 1159, 18, 332, 1190, 26, 16767, 2100]], [[19, 79, 242, 13, 951, 30, 234, 181], [69, 169, 8370, 2407, 88, 0, 215, 873, 74, 5, 74], [4779, 2025, 392, 214, 2432, 873, 135, 13, 602, 1904, 1612, 101, 5, 127, 33, 4, 242, 596, 101, 378], [0, 1630, 1802, 6, 33, 3079, 3, 69, 88, 120, 12], [20, 30, 2921, 5, 255, 190, 7, 173, 79], [127, 7, 3939, 161, 66, 197, 4, 159, 2358, 88, 7, 530, 3, 0, 161], [9837, 173983, 24073, 7, 85015, 2358, 12, 54, 6400, 1679, 60, 419, 12, 0, 1630, 1802, 5198], [0, 8443, 88081, 2683, 2680, 42, 288, 399, 5199, 159, 26, 2358], [39, 7368, 0, 2358, 773, 3, 1243, 101], [3786, 3, 2358, 33, 173, 275, 44, 4832, 1906, 5, 4676, 101, 5, 109811, 2449, 280, 30, 858, 219]], [[113, 3, 2358, 117, 37, 50, 179, 3, 1077, 4, 37, 2358, 30, 24073, 5, 50, 1554, 3, 2358, 30, 24073, 5, 1181, 0, 951, 7, 53, 346, 20, 30, 3045]]]}, {"title": "Analog and Digital Computers", "text": "In the first half of the 20th century, scientist<nowiki/>s started using computers, mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about science questions instead of spending hours adding numbers together.

However this is not the case as many consecutive attempts have been made to bring arithmetic logic to l3.Analogue computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems. some are used to control machines.", "paragraphs": [[[6, 0, 343, 3, 0, 589, 4756, 465, 234, 951, 1246, 113, 4756, 33, 7, 530, 3, 7460, 4, 1265, 66, 5, 303, 4, 2025, 181, 3, 44, 79, 269, 59, 1121, 995, 773, 3, 2025, 1152, 1679, 223, 600], [10, 880, 83, 39, 33, 4, 1783, 7, 3034, 1370, 39, 408, 4, 88, 7, 530, 3, 7460, 4, 159, 1085, 0, 3034, 161, 248], [100, 39, 339, 600, 951], [158, 12540, 951, 234, 12540, 3036, 42, 159, 101, 191, 605, 4, 371], [6, 0, 39, 24073, 2150, 951, 5, 720, 159, 101, 1673, 4, 371], [212, 37, 30, 36, 0, 305, 7, 109, 2470, 1266, 33, 30, 159, 4, 938, 21613, 7651, 4, 951, 30, 6331, 46, 2505, 3272, 42, 4441, 747], [77, 30, 234, 4, 424, 2358]]]}, {"title": "High-scale computers", "text": "Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s to 1940s.  Scientists made a lot of digital computers, and as they did, they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them.  Here are a few of the computers they built:\n\n\n\n\n* Konrad Zuse's electromechanical \"Z machines\". The Z3 (1941) was the first working machine that used binary arithmetic.  Binary arithmetic means using \"Yes\" and \"No.\" to add numbers together.  You could also program it.  In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be Turing complete.  Turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer.  It is the world's first modern computer.\n* The non-programmable Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer (1941) which used vacuum tubes to store \"yes\" and \"no\" answers, and regenerative capacitor memory.\n* The Harvard Mark I (1944), A big computer that you could kind of program.\n* The U.S. Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory ENIAC (1946), which could add numbers the way people do (using the numbers 0 through 9) and is sometimes called the first general purpose electronic computer (since Konrad Zuse's Z3 of 1941 used electromagnets instead of electronics). At first, however, the only way to reprogram ENIAC was by rewiring it.\n\nSeveral developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it, and a way to change what it remembered. This is known as \"stored program architecture\" or von Neumann architecture. John von Neumann talked about this design in the paper ''First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC'', distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time.  The first of these was completed in Great Britain. The first to be demonstrated working was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM or \"Baby\"), while the EDSAC, completed a year after SSEM, was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design. Shortly afterwards, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper\u2014EDVAC\u2014was completed but was not ready for two years.\n\nNearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture. It has become the main concept which defines a modern computer. The technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture.\n\n\n\nIn the 1950s computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes.  Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960s because they were smaller and cheaper.   They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on integrated circuits. Microprocessors, such as the Intel 4004 made computers smaller, cheaper, faster and more reliable. By the 1980s, microcontrollers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines. The 1980s also saw home computers and personal computers. With the evolution of the Internet, personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household.\n\nIn 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones (the N-series) \"multimedia computers\" and after the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007, many are now starting to add the smartphone category among \"real\" computers.  In 2008, if smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, was no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather Nokia.", "paragraphs": [[[2154, 1265, 66, 197, 4, 159, 5, 234, 2150, 951, 6, 0, 4], [2154, 159, 7, 530, 3, 2150, 951, 5, 7, 39, 88, 39, 1265, 66, 197, 4, 1712, 101, 0, 248, 2598, 3, 995, 4, 169, 0, 181, 66, 3, 101], [187, 30, 7, 306, 3, 0, 951, 39, 1190]], [], [[], [27270, 157254, 64855, 9026, 2358], [0, 30, 0, 161, 2358, 12, 234, 17011, 21613], [17011, 21613, 1702, 234, 2772, 5, 84, 4, 1679, 223, 600], [81, 86, 52, 371, 20], [6, 0, 30, 2827, 4, 30, 35852, 1336], [35852, 1336, 1702, 12, 20, 30, 555, 4, 1361, 37, 1671, 951, 1096, 12, 20, 30, 29827, 555, 4, 1361, 7, 951], [20, 30, 0, 85, 1194, 951], [0, 1337, 41591, 175844, 9307, 951, 42, 234, 9316, 7370, 4, 1612, 2772, 5, 84, 2168, 5, 42695, 45153, 2711], [], [0, 3332, 799, 41, 7, 365, 951, 12, 81, 86, 921, 3, 371], [], [0, 330, 41474, 520, 4186, 107683, 42, 86, 1679, 223, 0, 179, 69, 88, 234, 0, 223, 131, 5, 30, 1071, 580, 0, 216, 2800, 2505, 951, 108, 27270, 157254, 3, 234, 121774, 773, 3, 2505], [22, 212, 0, 91, 179, 4, 84130, 107683, 30, 21, 111971, 20]], [[201, 7127, 3, 107683, 253, 47, 747], [39, 24073, 7, 179, 4, 10, 7, 951, 4, 2715, 102, 39, 33, 1361, 20, 5, 7, 179, 4, 511, 102, 20, 2715], [37, 30, 346, 7, 1612, 371, 3858, 46, 4145, 21118, 3858], [279, 4145, 21118, 1077, 59, 37, 1252, 6, 0, 1307, 58, 1737, 3, 7, 255, 13, 0, 289286, 8649, 6], [7, 30355, 3, 716, 4, 1790, 951, 815, 13, 0, 1612, 371, 3858, 465, 204, 37, 79], [0, 3, 37, 30, 1336, 6, 353, 695], [0, 4, 30, 5928, 161, 30, 0, 2879, 357, 2121, 6122, 2358, 46, 2232, 110, 0, 326841, 1336, 7, 62, 49, 30, 0, 588, 4699, 951, 12, 234, 0, 1612, 371, 1252], [1860, 5647, 0, 2358, 1447, 4466, 21, 4145, 21118, 1307, 289286, 30, 1336, 34, 30, 36, 1188, 10, 55, 62]], [[573, 64, 1194, 951, 234, 0, 1612, 371, 3858], [20, 33, 399, 0, 444, 2986, 42, 6931, 7, 1194, 951], [0, 732, 234, 4, 1190, 951, 33, 511, 108, 0, 34, 109, 533, 951, 149, 234, 0, 4145, 21118, 3858]], [], [[6, 0, 951, 30, 1190, 66, 3, 1246, 9316, 7370], [34286, 2451, 9316, 7370, 6, 0, 113, 39, 30, 357, 5, 5115], [39, 52, 408, 333, 268, 5, 88, 36, 1129, 135, 7, 181, 7, 9316, 7370], [6, 0, 732, 30, 815, 13, 11556, 3036], [29814, 125, 7, 0, 5438, 159, 951, 357, 5115, 1605, 5, 181, 6300], [21, 0, 89894, 399, 357, 5, 5115, 575, 4, 2451, 6331, 424, 6, 873, 117, 9034, 2358], [0, 52, 253, 163, 951, 5, 894, 951], [17, 0, 5865, 3, 0, 925, 894, 951, 30, 399, 7, 861, 7, 0, 458, 5, 0, 1599, 6, 0, 3026]], [[6, 10565, 465, 4, 580, 77, 3, 47, 2372, 1264, 0, 3814, 281, 9876, 951, 5, 49, 0, 1783, 3, 0, 3292, 11693, 6, 109, 30, 114, 465, 4, 1679, 0, 30957, 2891, 244, 567, 951], [6, 83, 33452, 30, 488, 6, 0, 223, 3, 951, 6, 0, 85, 0, 365, 951, 2737, 21, 1207, 1243, 30, 84, 173, 11330, 10513, 34, 871, 10565]]]}, {"title": "Kinds of computers", "text": "There are many types of computers.

Most people keep them on top of a desk, which is why they are called \"desktop computers.\" \"Laptop computers\" are computers small enough to fit on your lap.  This makes them easy to carry around. Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers, because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music, surfing the web, or playing video games.\n\nThere are bigger computers that many people at a time can use.  These are called \"Mainframes,\" and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work. You can think of a personal computer like this:  the personal computer is like your skin:  you can see it, other people can see it, and through your skin you feel wind, water, air, and the rest of the world.  A mainframe is more like your internal organs: you never see them, and you barely even think about them, but if they suddenly went missing, you would have some very big problems.\n\nAn embedded computer, also called embedded system is a computer that does one thing and one thing only, and usually does it very well.  For example, an alarm clock is an embedded computer:  it tells the time.  Unlike your personal computer, you cannot use your clock to play Tetris.

However, when the northern people beat the Chinese people and came to rule the kingdom, they also Incorporated the Chinese way of living and became like the Chinese.

This was because Spain found enormous silver in the new continent, which was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.\n\nBy the time of the Renaissance, European powers started to take over other countries in Asia.  While China was never actually taken over, many European countries, such as Britain and France built spheres of influence in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries, by the Qing Dynasty, it had fallen behind other countries in technology, and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century.\n\nStill influenced by Western sources, China faced internal strife. The Taiping Rebellion or Taiping War occurred in China from 1851 through 1864. The Taiping Rebellion was led by Hong Xiuquan from Guangdon. Hong Xiuquan was influenced by Christian missionaries and declared himself the brother of Jesus. Hong made his mission to bring down the Qing Dynasty. Gaining influence on the southern Chinese population, the Taiping Rebellion attracted tens of thousands of supporters. The Taiping regime successfully created a state within the Qing Empire with the capital at Nanjing. Hong called his new state the Taiping Tianguo or \"The Heavenly State of Great Peace\". Local armies eventually suppressed the rebellion at the final battle of Nanjing. <ref>Mitter, Rana, ''Modern China: A Very Short Introduction'' P.22.</ref>\n\nIn 1911, the Republic of China was founded by Sun Yat-sen, but its government was very weak. Warlords controlled many areas. Chiang Kai-shek led wars against them, and he became President and dictator.\n\nIn 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, a place in the northeastern part of China. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked the rest of the country, starting what was called the Second Sino-Japanese War. The war later became part of World War II. The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed.\n\nHowever, the Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomintang (Nationalists) of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.\n\nUnder Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer.

If all of the above were added the list of U.N members there could be anything up to 211 countries based on the previous examples given. \n\nThere are however many more territories with unique political circumstances that could also be counted. \n\nDepending on how loosely the dictionary definition for the word country is used there could be anything from 193 countries in the world or more. The matter is purely subjective depending on varying opinions and there has never been any consideration as to what the maximum number of countries in the world could be. \n\nThere are multipule organisations that have their own lists of countries, one example being the Travellers Century Club which recognises 327 countries as of 01/01/18. <ref></ref>", "paragraphs": [[[19, 6931, 21, 23307, 1980, 7, 123, 30, 7, 1456, 17, 6131, 209, 6260, 12, 1547, 4519, 74, 7, 1902, 8170, 237, 17, 7, 2273, 485, 424, 21, 47, 261, 78, 12, 2322, 6726, 17, 68, 92], [63, 30, 84, 16260, 1863, 2168, 7, 4, 197, 109, 123, 6, 0, 85, 63, 1403, 30, 212, 0, 3311, 2168, 30, 10, 0, 104, 471, 393], []], [[63, 30, 109, 11223, 12, 86, 30, 159, 13, 37, 30355], [10, 880, 63, 30, 55, 104, 471, 6507, 92], [0, 4330, 115, 92, 5, 0, 92, 3, 5469], [37, 54, 1679, 55, 4, 0, 674, 3, 104, 471, 393, 92, 63, 10, 0, 30355, 3, 123, 0, 54, 30]], [[694, 30, 52, 1071, 24558, 7, 7, 123, 212, 63, 30, 7, 3203, 2074, 74, 694, 4519, 17, 0, 5527, 874, 3, 132]], [[37, 86, 30, 281809, 13, 151, 372, 21, 1679, 0, 12920, 123, 3, 0, 104, 1859, 0, 1859, 3, 0, 2238, 5, 0, 1859, 3, 3384, 42, 86, 1679, 4587, 25, 87, 4, 6030, 123, 4, 0, 1996, 30355]], [[63, 30, 7, 30355, 3, 2074, 237, 12, 33, 5932, 1372, 25, 44, 3792, 92, 5, 1653, 2514, 3275], [10, 880, 1701, 139, 10367, 5, 11816], [158, 30, 120, 77, 3, 0, 109, 880, 3, 17, 2514, 4, 84, 3275, 12, 30, 1071, 905, 7, 123]], [[63, 30, 7, 530, 3, 3187, 13620, 0, 1069, 880, 5, 1689, 456, 130, 48, 3, 37, 1456, 107, 30, 2428, 7, 123, 8850, 815, 13, 2166], [83, 64, 3, 0, 1069, 30, 1679, 0, 674, 3, 393, 63, 86, 30, 1096, 60, 4, 123, 815, 13, 0, 771, 880, 455]], [[63, 30, 212, 109, 181, 1456, 17, 3006, 209, 19070, 12, 86, 52, 30, 2428]], [[4349, 13, 197, 11783, 0, 10321, 4743, 10, 0, 1388, 123, 30, 234, 63, 86, 30, 1096, 25, 123, 6, 0, 85, 46, 181], [0, 4041, 30, 8850, 19581, 5946, 13, 7038, 2166, 5, 63, 33, 332, 30, 130, 5346, 7, 4, 102, 0, 2964, 30355, 3, 123, 6, 0, 85, 86, 30]], [[63, 30, 3263, 12, 33, 44, 261, 674, 3, 123, 48, 880, 30, 0, 15836, 589, 449, 42, 11530, 123, 7, 3], []]]}, {"title": "Constituent country", "text": "Constituent country is a term sometimes used, usually by official institutions, in contexts in which a number of countries compose a long entity or grouping.

{"title": "Creativity", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Creativity''' is the ability of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable, or the process of making something new and useful or valuable. It happens in all areas of life - science, art, literature and music. As a personal ability it is very difficult to measure. The reason is that we don't understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others. Judging what is creative is also controversial. Some people say only things which are historically new are creative, while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them, then it is also creativity.\n\nSome think creativity is an important thing that makes humans different from apes. Others recognize that even apes, other primates, other mammals and some birds adapt to survive by being creative (for example - primates using tools). Liane Gabora believes that all culture comes from creativity, not imitation. Therefore, these people say, human science should focus on it (pay special attention to it): Ethics for example would focus on finding creative solutions to ethical dilemmas. Politics would focus on the political virtues that need some creativity. Imitation would not be the focus of education. Linguistics might be more interested in how new words are created by culture, rather than in how existing ones are used in grammar.\n\nIntellectual interests (recognized as intellectual rights or intellectual property in the law) are a way to reward creativity in law, but they do not always work very well. A good example is copyright which is supposed to pay authors and artists, but may only pay lawyers to make (imitative) arguments in court.\n\nCreativity is a central question in economics, where it is known as '''ingenuity''' (the ability to come up with new ideas) or '''individual capital''' - capacities that individuals have, that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already.

Not all churches will have all these parts:\n\n* The '''nave''' is the main part of the church where the congregation (the people who come to worship) sit. \n* The '''aisles''' are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave.\n* The '''transept''', if there is one, is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church. This makes the church shaped like a cross, which is a symbol of Jesus's death on a cross.\n* The '''chancel''' leads up to the altar at the top of the church. The altar is in the '''sanctuary'''. The word \u201csanctuary\u201d means \u201csacred place\u201d. People were not allowed to be arrested in the sanctuary, so they were safe. The altar is usually at the east end of the church. People in the church sit facing the altar. We say that the church \u201cfaces east\u201d.\n* Churches will also have a '''tower''' or steeple, usually at the west end. If the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept.\n\nIn Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup (bowl) of holy water near the entrance of the church. This tradition comes from the fact that Roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance. The font is a bowl where people (often babies) are baptized. This is also near the entrance of the church. This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church.\n\nTraditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on. These are called '''pews'''. Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions. At the front of the nave is the '''pulpit''' where the priest preaches (these talks are called \u201csermons\u201d). There is also a lectern (like a large music stand) from where the lessons (the Bible readings) are read.\n\nIf there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof. In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars. This is called the '''triforium'''. Over the triforium is the '''clerestory''' which is a row of windows high up in the church wall.\n\nThe chancel is the most holy part of the church, and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone, or occasionally iron. The congregation can see through the screen. On the top of the screen there may be a cross. This is called a rood (pronounce like \u201crude\u201d) screen. Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel. Sometimes people sang from there.\n\nInside the chancel are the benches where the choir sit. These are called '''choir stalls'''. They are on both sides. The two sides of the choir sit facing one another. The choir members who sit on the left (north side) are called \u201ccantoris\u201d (the side where the \u201ccantor\u201d sits) and those on the right (south side) are called \u201cdecani\u201d (the side where the deacon sits). In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up. The top of these seats, when they are tipped up, are called '''misericords''' (from the Latin word for \u201cmercy\u201d). This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time.\n\nSometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through. These are called '''squints'''. If there is a recess in the wall it is called an '''aumbry'''.

The end of the church (end of the sanctuary) was often rounded. Hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of wood.\n* The Norman period (1050\u20131190) came from the style called Romanesque which was popular in Europe. The arches had ornaments which were called \u201cmouldings\u201d. The tops of the pillars looked like cushions, so they were called \u201ccushion capitals\u201d. The windows were narrow and rounded at the top.\n* Early English or Gothic architecture (1190\u20131280) was not as solid and heavy as Norman architecture. Towers were elegant and tall, like the tower of Salisbury Cathedral.\n* The Decorated style of architecture (1280\u20131360)was popular at a time when the plague (Black Death) was raging and a third of the people in England died. For that reason, not so much building was done then. There were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time.\n* The Perpendicular style (1360\u20131540) was very grand. It had lots of straight upward lines and fan vaulting. This can be seen in Westminster Abbey and King's College Chapel, Cambridge. Many churches that can be seen in England were built in this period.\n\nIn the 1600s, churches were built in a variety of styles. Often they copied some of the older styles. After the Great Fire of London many new churches were built by the architect Sir Christopher Wren. They were built in the classical style. Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this, but also the Gothic style continued to be used.\n\nModern churches often do not have the traditional cross-shape. It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel. Modern churches bring the congregation, choir and priests in closer touch. An example is the round design for the Church of Christ the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes. Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches. Many have beautiful mosaic glass windows. Coventry Cathedral is a famous example of a modern church building.", "paragraphs": [[[6, 711, 512, 63, 30, 201, 494, 566, 3, 3858]], [[], [0, 16793, 566, 30, 7, 79, 61, 512, 30, 191, 2147], [0, 156, 3, 0, 512, 156, 3, 0, 8359, 30, 456, 469], [4592, 130, 30, 891, 114, 113, 39, 30, 1246, 159, 3, 2753], [], [0, 4965, 566, 326, 25, 0, 1135, 580, 25468, 42, 30, 814, 6, 525], [0, 8129, 33, 32246, 42, 30, 580, 71353], [0, 220, 3, 0, 13808, 662, 117, 15009, 100, 39, 30, 580, 15009, 351], [0, 3453, 30, 3757, 5, 469, 22, 0, 220], [], [199, 711, 46, 10006, 3858, 30, 36, 7, 3051, 5, 1106, 7, 4965, 3858], [6037, 30, 9460, 5, 4444, 117, 0, 2935, 3, 16754, 4797], [], [0, 7468, 1135, 3, 3858, 814, 22, 7, 79, 61, 0, 11075, 521, 336, 30, 9012, 5, 7, 314, 3, 0, 69, 6, 563, 2357], [10, 12, 1247, 36, 100, 181, 1190, 30, 88, 127], [63, 30, 530, 3, 2155, 17372, 30, 159, 6, 512, 22, 12, 79], [0, 25778, 1135, 30, 191, 1063], [20, 33, 530, 3, 1362, 8825, 331, 5, 3267, 10811], [37, 86, 30, 253, 6, 10151, 7056, 5, 691, 499, 5468, 4804], [109, 512, 12, 86, 30, 253, 6, 563, 30, 1190, 6, 37, 566]], [[6, 0, 512, 30, 1190, 6, 7, 2165, 3, 1135], [456, 39, 4522, 77, 3, 0, 167, 1135], [49, 0, 353, 484, 3, 516, 109, 50, 512, 30, 1190, 21, 0, 4493, 2699, 3257, 31060], [39, 30, 1190, 6, 0, 4260, 1135], [3694, 660, 4, 30, 1190, 6, 288, 589, 117, 37, 34, 52, 0, 10006, 1135, 660, 4, 30, 234]], [[1194, 512, 456, 88, 36, 33, 0, 1274, 1007, 3030], [20, 30, 1013, 10, 0, 7615, 4, 253, 5, 2271, 102, 30, 1927, 6, 0, 25210], [1194, 512, 938, 0, 7615, 8051, 5, 4314, 6, 383, 3255], [29, 880, 30, 0, 469, 1252, 10, 0, 512, 3, 4904, 0, 13669, 6, 10007, 26665], [1194, 512, 30, 456, 2147, 34, 17, 7, 3547, 1395, 73, 0, 10006, 512], [109, 33, 3366, 17313, 2847, 3453], [13163, 4797, 30, 7, 1613, 880, 3, 7, 1194, 512, 1190]]]}, {"title": "Related pages", "text": "*Cathedral\n*Chapel\n*Choir (music)", "paragraphs": [[[], [4797], [5468], [8051, 403]]]}, {"title": "References", "text": "* Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1973", "paragraphs": [[[], [52644, 34481]]]}, {"title": "Other websites", "text": "* Virtual Church", "paragraphs": [[[5289, 512]]]}]}

Although many cities today have only been around for tens or hundreds of years, there are a few which have been so for thousands of years. For example, Athens, Greece was founded in 1000 BC and Rome, Italy has existed since 700 BC.\n* A large population. Cities can have millions of people living in and around them. Among them is Tokyo, Japan, and the Tokyo Metropolis around it, which includes Yokohama and Chiba.\n* A centre where business and government takes place. The first case is often described as the financial capital, such as Frankfurt in Germany. The second case is true for different levels of government, whether they are local or part of a larger region (for example, Atlanta, Georgia, or an entire country (for example, Washington, D.C.). Cities which contain the government of the region it is in are called capitals. Almost every country has its own capital.\n* Special powers called town privileges which have been given by the government of the country, or its ruler. This was done especially in Europe during the Middle Ages.\n* Having a cathedral or a university. This rule is found in the United Kingdom.

This depends on the type of city that it is. Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much, are very much smaller than modern cities. There are two main reasons. One reason is that old cities often have a city wall, and most of the city is inside it. Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow. If the city got too big, it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the market place. People in cities need food, and the food always has to come from outside the city. Cities that were on a river like London could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like Sienna in Italy, because the river made a transport route for carrying food and other goods, as well as for transporting people. London has been changing continually for hundreds of years, while Siena, which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years. Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large, because the streets are wide enough for cars, buses and trucks, and there are often railway lines as well.\n\nIn the US, the word city is often used for towns that are not very big. When the first European people went to America, they gave the name \"city\" to new places. They hoped the places would be great cities in the future. For example, Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people. When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City (for the nearby Great Salt Lake). Now, 150 years later, it really is a big city. \n\nIn modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger. The whole area is often called a ''\"metropolis\"'' and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages. The ''metropolis'' of London includes the City of London, the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill, Southwark, Richmond, Greenwich and etc. The part that is officially known as the \"City of London\" only takes up one square mile. The rest is known as \"Greater London\". Many other cities have grown in the same way. \n\nThese giant cities can be exciting places to live, and many people can find good jobs there, but modern cities also have many problems. Many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get money by begging or by crime. Cars, factories, and waste create a lot of pollution that makes people sick. the smallest city is Urban history \n\nUrban History is history of civilization. The first cities were made in ancient times, as soon as people began to create civilization. Famous ancient cities which fell to ruins included Babylon, Troy, Mycenae and Mohenjo Daro.\n\nBenares in northern India is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years. Other cities that have existed since ancient times are Athens in Greece, Rome and Volterra in Italy, Alexandria in Egypt and York in England.\n\nIn Europe, in the Middle Ages, being a city was a special privilege, granted by nobility. Cities that fall into this category, usually had (or still have) city walls. The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not. Medieval cities that still have walls include Carcassonne in France, Tehran in Iran, Toledo in Spain and Canterbury in England. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, a city is a town which people have always called a city, or which has got the name \"city\" status by royal charter (a special paper from the king or queen). Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important. In the past, cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university. Some cathedral cities, for example St David's, are small, and people do not normally think of them as cities. Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges. The university cities of Oxford and Cambridge are famous throughout the world. The largest city is Shanghai, while the fastest growing is Dubai. The smallest city in the UK is Wells.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 1275, 3, 115, 86, 30, 191, 494], [37, 5946, 13, 0, 1554, 3, 115, 12, 20, 30], [1183, 12, 30, 1190, 3079, 3, 62, 363, 5, 42, 33, 36, 511, 181, 30, 191, 181, 357, 73, 1194, 115], [63, 30, 55, 444, 1247], [48, 1247, 30, 12, 167, 115, 456, 33, 7, 115, 1015, 5, 181, 3, 0, 115, 30, 1038, 20], [170, 481, 1247, 30, 12, 0, 491, 6, 167, 115, 30, 456, 3757], [83, 0, 115, 169, 317, 365, 20, 30, 605, 10, 7, 9634, 1619, 565, 4, 169, 4, 0, 211, 241], [69, 6, 115, 408, 565, 5, 0, 565, 690, 33, 4, 326, 25, 587, 0, 115], [1183, 12, 30, 13, 7, 620, 117, 516, 86, 2274, 181, 365, 73, 115, 12, 30, 13, 7, 1611, 117, 48066, 6, 931, 113, 0, 620, 159, 7, 1878, 1314, 10, 1619, 565, 5, 68, 219, 7, 219, 7, 10, 1878, 69], [516, 33, 30, 511, 12313, 10, 3079, 3, 62, 110, 18087, 42, 30, 7, 191, 481, 115, 6, 0, 33, 511, 191, 333, 6, 62], [1194, 115, 17, 1194, 1878, 278, 86, 2274, 191, 426, 113, 0, 491, 30, 1260, 575, 10, 569, 1708, 5, 2575, 5, 63, 30, 456, 1609, 331, 7, 219]], [[6, 0, 95, 0, 1388, 115, 30, 456, 234, 10, 328, 12, 30, 36, 191, 365], [61, 0, 291, 69, 242, 4, 453, 39, 455, 0, 311, 115, 4, 50, 241], [39, 824, 0, 241, 54, 30, 353, 115, 6, 0, 581], [10, 880, 2982, 1241, 115, 30, 0, 311, 455, 4, 7, 633, 3, 69], [61, 39, 465, 1190, 0, 328, 39, 159, 491, 394, 5, 580, 20, 353, 2982, 1241, 115, 10, 0, 1482, 353, 2982, 1241], [114, 62, 288, 20, 588, 30, 7, 365, 115]], [[6, 1194, 79, 109, 115, 33, 2274, 365, 5, 365], [0, 1115, 237, 30, 456, 580, 7, 15633, 5, 86, 1071, 488, 201, 357, 2359, 328, 5, 633], [0, 15633, 3, 516, 488, 0, 115, 3, 516, 0, 115, 3, 10151, 5, 109, 167, 633, 125, 7, 47324, 1319, 37622, 6301, 11370, 5, 34339], [0, 153, 12, 30, 2391, 346, 7, 0, 115, 3, 516, 91, 190, 60, 48, 1249, 2586], [0, 1033, 30, 346, 7, 1413, 516], [109, 68, 115, 33, 2274, 6, 0, 215, 179]], [[158, 1752, 115, 86, 30, 26638, 241, 4, 682, 5, 109, 69, 86, 596, 219, 664, 63, 34, 1194, 115, 52, 33, 109, 747], [109, 69, 86, 36, 596, 664, 6, 0, 115, 5, 33, 4, 169, 308, 21, 16971, 46, 21, 1340], [1277, 2726, 5, 3631, 1210, 7, 530, 3, 4570, 12, 159, 69, 4478], [0, 357, 115, 30, 2227, 299]], [[2227, 299, 30, 299, 3, 9390], [0, 115, 30, 159, 6, 2359, 79, 7, 720, 7, 69, 1092, 4, 1210, 9390], [1613, 2359, 115, 42, 807, 4, 11346, 488, 20200, 6488, 104557, 5, 221710]], [[93560, 6, 529, 474, 30, 48, 244, 0, 2359, 115, 42, 33, 7, 299, 3, 181, 62], [68, 115, 12, 33, 3604, 108, 2359, 79, 30, 3264, 6, 2107, 2618, 5, 103399, 6, 931, 9576, 6, 1598, 5, 196, 6, 563]], [[6, 525, 6, 0, 699, 3875, 30, 7, 115, 30, 7, 557, 9555, 2364, 21, 14647], [1183, 12, 807, 75, 37, 2891, 1140, 33, 46, 149, 33, 115, 1015], [0, 69, 38, 682, 6, 0, 115, 30, 9555, 74, 12, 38, 88, 36], [6101, 115, 12, 149, 33, 1015, 488, 71504, 6, 387, 2966, 6, 545, 9795, 6, 1029, 5, 10457, 6, 563]], [[6, 0, 104, 1859, 7, 115, 30, 7, 328, 42, 69, 33, 690, 580, 7, 115, 46, 42, 33, 169, 0, 311, 115, 1416, 21, 1142, 3812, 7, 557, 1307, 25, 0, 691, 46, 2060], [1183, 1140, 169, 37, 113, 39, 33, 7, 557, 30355, 3, 69, 46, 30, 481], [6, 0, 341, 115, 169, 12, 311, 83, 39, 33, 7, 4797, 46, 7, 221], [77, 4797, 115, 10, 880, 2696, 684, 30, 357, 5, 69, 88, 36, 3520, 269, 3, 101, 7, 115], [1183, 12, 399, 115, 113, 3, 44, 221, 1573, 2274, 113, 181, 69, 483, 63, 4, 30, 11301, 22, 0, 221, 499], [0, 221, 115, 3, 4520, 5, 4804, 30, 1613, 983, 0, 85], [0, 426, 115, 30, 2205, 110, 0, 1605, 2274, 30, 5105], [0, 357, 115, 6, 0, 2046, 30, 4407]]]}, {"title": "World's largest cities", "text": "These cities have more than 10 million people:\n\n*Tokyo, Japan -

Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries.  Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from religions or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created. For example, a religion might consider eating a particular food to be a crime.  When automobiles became numerous, they killed or hurt many people in road accidents, so new laws were made for them.\n\nIn many countries, if people say they made or wrote a book, movie, song, or Web page that they did not really make or write, it is a crime against copyright laws. In many countries, helping to grow, make, move, or sell illegal drugs is a crime.\n\nIn most countries, police try to stop crimes and to find criminals. When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal, they usually hold the person in a jail. Then, usually, a court or a judge decides if the person really did a crime. If the court or judge decides that the person really did it, then he or she might have to pay a fine or go to prison. Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be executed (killed).

It is a cereal grain which was first grown by people in ancient Central America. It is now the third most important cereal crop in the world. However, little of this maize is eaten directly by humans. Most is used to make corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.\n\nMaize is a leafy stalk whose kernels have seeds inside. It is an angiosperm, which means that its seeds are enclosed inside a fruit or shell. It is has long been a staple food by many people in Mexico, Central and South America and parts of Africa. In Europe and the rest of North America, maize is grown mostly for use as animal feed. In Canada and the United States, maize is commonly referred to as \"corn\".  \n\nCenturies of cross breeding have produced larger plants, and specialized varieties. Corn has become an important ingredient in American foods through the use of corn starch.

It can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve, figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve, or find answers to problems in the electricity and magnetism areas of physics, among many other uses.\n\nMany amounts can be variables, which can change their value unlike numbers such as 5 or 200. Some examples of variables are distance and time. The speed of an object is how far it travels in a particular time. So if a town is 80 kilometres (50 miles) away and a person in a car gets there in one hour, they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour. But this is only an average \u2014 they may have been traveling faster at some times (on a highway) and slower at others (at a traffic light or on a small street where people live). Imagine a driver trying to figure out a car's speed using only its odometer (distance meter) and clock, without a speedometer!\n\nUntil calculus was invented, the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces, so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time. This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out.\n\n\n\nA very similar problem is to find the slope (how steep it is) at any point on a curve. The slope of a ''straight'' line is easy to work out \u2014 it is simply how much it goes up (''y'' or vertical) divided by how much it goes across (''x'' or horizontal). On a ''curve'', though, the slope is a variable (has different values at different points) because the line bends. But if the curve was to be cut into very, very small pieces, the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line. So to work out its slope, a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point. If it is done exactly right, the straight line will have the same slope as the curve, and is called a tangent. But there is no way to know (without very complicated mathematics) whether the tangent is exactly right, and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close.\n\nWhat Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope (or the speed in the distance example) exactly, using simple and logical rules. They divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces. They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each. As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in, the slope ''approached'' a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve. The particular value it approached was the actual slope.\n\n\n\nLet's say we have a function <math>y=f(x)</math>. f is short for function, so this equation means \"y is a function of x\". This tells us that how high y is on the vertical axis depends on what x (the horizontal axis) is at that time. For example, with the equation <math>y=x^2</math>, we know that if <math>x</math> is 1, then <math>y</math> will be 1; if <math>x</math>is 3, then <math>y</math> will be 9; if ''<math>x</math>'' is 20, then ''<math>y</math>'' will be 400. The '''derivative''' produced using this method here is <math>2x</math>, or 2 multiplied by ''<math>x</math>''. So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve <math>f(x)=x^2</math>, the '''derivative,''' <math>f'(x)</math> (marked with the prime symbol), will be <math>2x</math> at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called '''differentiation''', or finding the derivative.\n\nThe way to write the derivative in mathematics is\n<math>f^\\prime(x) = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}.</math>\n\nLeibniz came to the same result, but called h \"<math>dx</math>\", which means \"with respect to x\".

For example, the Bayeux Tapestry shows the return of Halley's Comet and the death of a king. Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine.  During the Renaissance, astronomers started to look at comets with less superstition and to base their science on observations. Tycho Brahe reasoned that comets did not come from the earth, and his calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon.\n\nEdmond Halley reasoned that some comets are periodic, that is, they appear again after a certain number of years, and again and again. This led to the first prediction of a comet's return, Halley's Comet, named after him.\n\nIsaac Newton also studied comets. He realised that comets make U-turns around the sun. He asked his friend Edmond Halley to publish this in his book ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''. Before Newton said this, people believed that comets go in to the sun, then another comes out from behind the sun. \n\nIn later years some astronomers thought comets were spit out by planets, especially Jupiter.\n\nAll this new information and research gave people confidence, but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods.

The Holy Bible is a combination of the Hebrew Bible, or Torah, and a collection of writings called the New Testament.  Views on the importance of these writings vary.  Some Christian groups prefer to favor the New Testament, while others believe the entire Bible is equally important.  Also, while many Christians prefer to consider the Bible as true, inspired by God, not all groups believe that it is completely accurate.  Some of these groups may think that the Bible is a collection of stories meant to show who God is, or even just the opinions of humans that reveal some commonly-believed truth.\n\nThe issue of \"who is a Christian?\" can be very controversial.  Christians often disagree over this issue due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters. It is not possible to provide a statement that all readers may agree with, therefore, a definition will not be provided.  Even very traditional doctrines such as the belief that Jesus Christ is God, or that God consists of the Father, Son, and Spirit, are not common to people who claim Christianity as their religion. \n\nMany Christians choose to go to church. Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship.  However, some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church.  Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue, most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ, whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week.  On the other hand, Catholics believe that the Holy Catholic Church is the only true church.\n\nIn some Christian movements (especially Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism), to be a '''born-again Christian''' is to undergo a \"spiritual rebirth\"", "paragraphs": [[[7, 1377, 30, 7, 899, 38, 733, 6, 7282, 7, 64046, 2830], [7282, 30, 1246, 59, 0, 214, 5, 3174, 3, 3993, 4904, 6, 0, 50, 9068, 29126], [], [5, 14093, 3, 86444, 6, 0, 7585, 5489, 167], [], [7282, 30, 0, 85, 426, 2830, 17, 160, 21717, 204, 0], []], [[1377, 1568, 0, 2677, 5489, 4, 30, 7, 6404, 539, 11356, 21, 1533], [0, 2677, 5489, 30, 7, 3398, 3, 0, 7585, 5489, 46, 16848, 5, 7, 1720, 3, 1649, 580, 0, 50, 9068], [2320, 13, 0, 2604, 3, 37, 1649, 7038], [77, 1377, 129, 5750, 4, 2544, 0, 50, 9068, 110, 68, 733, 0, 1452, 5489, 30, 5095, 481], [52, 110, 109, 1377, 5750, 4, 1568, 0, 5489, 7, 1446, 11356, 21, 1533, 36, 64, 129, 733, 12, 20, 30, 2215, 5697], [77, 3, 37, 129, 107, 269, 12, 0, 5489, 30, 7, 1720, 3, 523, 1702, 4, 273, 38, 1533, 30, 46, 151, 120, 0, 2166, 3, 473, 12, 5276, 77, 3659, 733, 2745]], [[0, 495, 3, 38, 30, 7, 1377, 86, 30, 191, 2782], [1377, 456, 10027, 74, 37, 495, 445, 4, 44, 2333, 6, 2166, 13, 4289, 1120], [20, 30, 36, 555, 4, 761, 7, 374, 12, 64, 6958, 107, 2137, 17, 2317, 7, 4743, 43, 36, 30, 761], [151, 191, 1274, 8218, 125, 7, 0, 4440, 12, 3993, 4904, 30, 1533, 46, 12, 1533, 9243, 3, 0, 629, 630, 5, 2943, 30, 36, 861, 4, 69, 38, 1547, 7282, 7, 44, 2830]], [[109, 1377, 3008, 4, 242, 4, 512], [96, 1377, 733, 37, 4, 30, 7, 1100, 3, 44, 1213, 12941, 4, 1533, 5, 7, 743, 3, 7071], [212, 77, 1377, 129, 269, 12, 48, 86, 30, 7, 1377, 296, 661, 242, 4, 7, 512], [413, 63, 30, 109, 494, 18008, 13, 0, 495, 181, 5805, 733, 64, 1377, 30, 153, 3, 0, 4289, 512, 3, 4904, 401, 46, 36, 12, 1377, 242, 4, 7, 3570, 512, 236, 147], [13, 0, 68, 823, 1538, 733, 12, 0, 2677, 1538, 512, 30, 0, 91, 1446, 512]], [[6, 77, 1377, 926, 858, 24848, 5, 104003, 4, 30, 7, 3045, 378, 1377, 30, 4, 7855, 7, 4289, 20324]]]}, {"title": "Related pages", "text": "* Christianity\n* Religion\n* Salvation", "paragraphs": [[[], [7282, 2830], [10532]]]}, {"title": "References", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}]}

People from Cuba are called Cubans. The official language is Spanish. Cuba is warm all year.\n\nIn 1492, Christopher Columbus landed on the island of Cuba. He claimed it for the Kingdom of Spain. Cuba became a Spanish colony until the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898. After the war, it was part of the United States. It gained independence in 1902.\n\nIn 1959, guerilla fighters led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara overthrew Cuba 's dictator Fulgencio Batista in what became the 'Cuban Revolution'. Castro began making relations with the Soviet Union and tried to close a lot of American businesses in Cuba; the United States did not like this. In 1961 Castro officially announced that his government was socialist. The US attempted to invade Cuba to regain control of it and overthrow it's communist led government but failed. The Communist Party of Cuba was created in 1965 and has ruled the island ever since. Today, Cuba is the only communist state outside of Asia, in the Caribbean, and in the western hemisphere.", "paragraphs": [[[2192, 30, 7, 583, 123, 6, 0, 3577, 937], [0, 123, 30, 159, 60, 3, 0, 365, 583, 3, 2192, 0, 29660, 342, 1047, 57193, 583, 10429, 3, 1875, 5, 109, 357, 583], [8184, 30, 0, 351, 3, 2192], [20, 30, 0, 426, 115], [0, 232, 426, 115, 30, 7224, 342, 2192], [6, 1141, 0, 351, 30, 580, 1047, 40967], [2192, 30, 355, 0, 104, 112, 856, 3836, 6130, 5, 0, 10953], [69, 25, 2192, 30, 580, 3396], [0, 239, 1032, 30, 1141], [2192, 30, 3547, 64, 62]], [[6, 3257, 6352, 607, 13, 0, 583, 3, 2192], [18, 1547, 20, 10, 0, 1859, 3, 1029], [2192, 399, 7, 1141, 4717, 207, 0, 1141, 140, 136, 3], [49, 0, 136, 20, 30, 153, 3, 0, 104, 112], [20, 1885, 1372, 6]], [[6, 33465, 3510, 410, 21, 7832, 4257, 5, 19227, 21991, 8708, 2192, 6498, 66355, 22839, 6, 102, 399, 0, 3396, 2525], [4257, 1092, 159, 6726, 17, 0, 1332, 354, 5, 841, 4, 383, 7, 530, 3, 140, 258, 6, 2192, 0, 104, 112, 88, 36, 117, 37], [6, 4257, 2391, 4070, 12, 26, 78, 30, 3435], [0, 95, 1266, 4, 13069, 2192, 4, 7442, 424, 3, 20, 5, 8708, 1501, 410, 78, 34, 4355], [0, 1501, 165, 3, 2192, 30, 1210, 6, 5, 33, 1067, 0, 583, 661, 108], [373, 2192, 30, 0, 91, 1501, 92, 587, 3, 831, 6, 0, 3577, 5, 6, 0, 556, 8687]]]}, {"title": "Culture", "text": "Cuba is famous for many types of music, especially dance music such as the Salsa and Mambo.

They were the Ta\u00ednos, the Ciboneys, and the Guanajatabeyes. The Ta\u00ednos were the largest and most common of the three tribes. They farmed crops such as beans, corn, squash, and yams. The Ta\u00ednos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world. Then, in 1492, Christopher Columbus arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas. Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish. The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards. The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them. Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans. The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them.\n\nThe Spanish ruled for many years. Cuba became the most important producer of sugar. In the early 1800s, Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers, but failed until 1898, when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them. Cuba became American for four years afterwards, before it became an independent republic in 1902. Even though Cuba was independent, the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the Platt Amendment. In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment, but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics. Americans owned most of Cuba\u2019s businesses. The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista, who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt.\n\nIn addition to political control, the United States also exercised significant control over the Cuban economy. At the time, Cuba was a monoculture economy. While they produced coffee, tobacco, and rice, they relied primarily on sugar. Thus, they were known by other countries as the \"sugar bowl of the world.\"<ref></ref> The United States bought sugar from the Republic of Cuba at a price higher than the global standard. In exchange, Cuba was to give preference to the United States, and its industries. Cuba depended on the United States and their investments. Cuba was not industrialized and needed the revenue for goods and oil. They also needed the US investment for gas, electricity, communications, railways, and banks. While Cuban workers had better conditions than other countries in the continent, they still faced inequality, lack of infrastructure, high illiteracy rates, and a lack of full-time work (the sugar industry was seasonal).", "paragraphs": [[[106, 2192, 30, 16461, 21, 0, 9754, 87, 5119, 682, 13, 0, 583], [39, 30, 0, 210208, 0, 5, 0], [0, 210208, 30, 0, 426, 5, 181, 861, 3, 0, 87, 5119], [39, 1988, 5413, 125, 7, 11239, 4719, 13924, 5, 30243], [0, 210208, 52, 4294, 6, 45294, 42, 0, 9754, 54, 5354, 4, 0, 1033, 3, 0, 85], [127, 6, 3257, 6352, 3704, 6, 2192, 13, 26, 1305, 4, 0, 7755], [87, 62, 288, 18, 1547, 0, 583, 10, 0, 1141], [0, 1141, 1092, 4, 1067, 2192, 5647], [0, 1141, 938, 4119, 3, 7517, 25, 637, 4, 2192, 4, 161, 10, 101], [96, 3, 0, 1683, 3396, 2357, 113, 3, 0, 50, 1289, 938, 21, 0, 1141, 5, 685], [0, 1141, 52, 4320, 0, 1683, 3396, 191, 42284, 5, 4912, 109, 3, 101]], [[0, 1141, 1067, 10, 109, 62], [2192, 399, 0, 181, 481, 1938, 3, 3191], [6, 0, 199, 3396, 1565, 98, 0, 1141, 7154, 34, 4355, 207, 61, 0, 104, 112, 242, 4, 136, 17, 0, 1141, 5, 1841, 101], [2192, 399, 140, 10, 133, 62, 5647, 106, 20, 399, 7, 920, 874, 6], [151, 413, 2192, 30, 920, 0, 140, 149, 424, 0, 583, 21, 7, 264, 580, 0, 23142, 3394], [6, 0, 3396, 837, 0, 23142, 3394, 34, 0, 140, 149, 33, 7, 365, 203, 6, 3396, 51757], [140, 261, 181, 3, 2192, 258], [0, 140, 280, 0, 329, 66355, 22839, 38, 30, 253, 21, 109, 3396, 7, 6826]], [[6, 1072, 4, 209, 424, 0, 104, 112, 52, 2958, 1209, 424, 74, 0, 3396, 427], [22, 0, 79, 2192, 30, 7, 109036, 427], [110, 39, 1711, 3424, 3179, 5, 1818, 39, 5656, 2831, 13, 3191], [1580, 39, 30, 346, 21, 68, 123, 7, 0, 3191, 1991, 3, 0], [0, 104, 112, 987, 3191, 25, 0, 874, 3, 2192, 22, 7, 626, 152, 73, 0, 701, 1224], [6, 643, 2192, 30, 4, 455, 9457, 4, 0, 104, 112, 5, 47, 459], [2192, 5946, 13, 0, 104, 112, 5, 44, 783], [2192, 30, 36, 112353, 5, 408, 0, 1651, 10, 219, 5, 316], [39, 52, 408, 0, 95, 783, 10, 851, 2636, 3572, 1609, 5, 231], [110, 3396, 3219, 33, 143, 1217, 73, 68, 123, 6, 0, 4944, 39, 149, 621, 15687, 1492, 3, 2951, 152, 27422, 571, 5, 7, 1492, 3, 549, 79, 161, 0, 3191, 459, 30, 8417]]]}, {"title": "Cuban Revolution", "text": "In 1959, Fidel Castro led a revolution against Fulgencio Batista. Castro took power in Cuba with Che Guevara from Argentina, his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba. He ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans went to America because of this. In 1961, the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and try to remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The Soviet Union put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at the United States. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the ''Cuban Missile Crisis''. The Soviet Union removed the missiles when the United States agreed to not continue attacking Cuba and to remove missiles from Turkey.\n\nCuba became a communist-led country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba\u2019s sugar for expensive prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba\u2019s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world. The army fought in Africa to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries.\n\nHowever, the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system. Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed. Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba. Most Cubans who left went to the United States. Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail. Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this, and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power.\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as \u201cThe Special Period\u201d. Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government, more discussion amongst the people, and private shops and businesses. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island.\n\nIn the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though Fidel Castro had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro was one of the longest-serving heads of state. In 2018, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel became the official President of Cuba.\n\nIn April 2015, historic talks took place with US President Obama and Cuban General Secretary Ra\u00fal Castro in improving relations between the two nations.\n\nThe trade embargo issued by President Kennedy in the 1960s has been considerably loosened under Obama's administration. US citizens can now travel directly to Cuba at certain times of the year. Before, Americans had to go via Mexico if they wanted to go to Cuba.

The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish. The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same. According to a DNA Caribbean Studies Institute, the racial-makeup of the population of Cuba is:\n* European Cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late 15th century and onward. Most white Cubans came from many different parts of Spain, but the most numerous were the Canary Islanders, Andalusians, and Catalans. There was as well some French, Italian and English peoples. Whites makeup approximately 30% of Cuba's population as of 2012, and they mostly populate the west part of Cuba, specially cities like Havana and Pinar del Rio. These brought with them their language, religions, music and others.\n* Africans and Mulatto Cubans descend from the arrival of African slaves that came from various parts of Africa but the most numerous were West Africans. There were also more than 500,000 Haitians that came to Cuba during the Haitian Revolution days. Most Cuban slaves tended to come from the Kongo and Yoruba tribes, there were also the Igbos, Ewes, Fons, Fulas, Mandinkas and some others. Afro-Cubans range enormously from 33.9 percent to 70 percent of the population, and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of Cuba. These brought with them their instruments, reigion (Santeria), and customs to the Cuban culture.\n* Mediterranean Cubans are about 3% of the population, however; one must know that a lot of the Southern Spaniard Cuban descendants have good portion of Moor blood in their family lines; due to the close proximate Spain is to North Africa. Many Mediterranean Cubans came during the 1820s-1880s and sometimes onward. These are most concentrated in the East specially cities like Guantanamo Bay.

There are many kinds of dances, and every human society has its own dances.\n\nDancing is not a sport, though it does have some athletic aspects. Dance is an art. Some people dance to express their feelings and emotions. Other people dance to feel better. Dance can be used to tell a story. In some societies, dance goes with song as well as music.

Every society has its own dances. There are pictures, on pottery and stone, which show dances from several thousand years ago, in Egypt and Greece.<ref name=\"Sachs\">Sachs, Curt 1937. ''The world history of the dance''. Norton, N.Y. <sup>Chapter5</sup> </ref>\n\nSachs divides early dances into 'Imageless dances' and 'Image dances'. By 'imageless dances' he meant dances which have no set form, but aim at getting the dancers into a state of ecstasy. In this state the dancer(s) seem changed, in a trance, and are often thought of (by their society) as being 'possessed by spirits'. These dances are done on certain occasions: marriage, war, famine, illness or death, and so on. They are found in all early ('primitive') societies.<ref name=Sachs/><sup>p49; 62</sup>\n\nThe 'image dances', according to Sachs, are to do with the world outside the dancer. By imitating an animal or object, the dancer believes he can capture a power and make it useful. To dance in imitation of the animal which is going to be hunted is to become one with them. To imitate the act of sex is to achieve fertility. This is the kind of thinking behind an image dance. Sachs points out that societies of this kind do not really understand the connection between cause and effect. They really believe the image dances work. The dance type which is used in image dances is mime.<ref name=Sachs/><sup>p49; 77</sup>\n\nThe two styles of dance may be joined together. Fertility dances may involve both ecstatic states and mime. The great dancer Nijinsky used some of these ideas in his choreography for the ballet ''Le Sacre du Printemps'' (The Rite of Spring), a ballet about the sacrifice of a girl during a primitive celebration of Spring.\n\nIn more recent times, the first dance school we know about was opened in 1661 in Paris. Only men were accepted until 1681. After 1681, women were accepted too. Ballroom dances are forms of modern dance. Ballroom dances such as the waltz are done by couples.\n\nUntil the 20th century, most ballroom dances were sequence dances. The way people moved was planned in set formation. These formations were usually lines or squares. Everyone moved at the same time, and finished at the same time. The music played for a set time, and then stopped. After the invention of the waltz, around 1800, another style of dancing developed.<ref>Wood, Melusine 1952. ''Historical dances: 12th to 19th centuries''. Dance Books, London.</ref> In the waltz, and later dances, people danced in couples, but they did so separately. They did not dance in formation, but moved round the room as they pleased (but anti-clockwise). Often, new dance styles arrive. Some dance as individuals, separately, as they please. Street dance is like that. All these types of dance have music.\n\nAt the same time, round the world there are many traditional dances. Some of them have been going for hundreds of years. We call them folkloric dances.\n\nThe coming of popular music videos and DVDs led to a kind of dancer previously seen in some stage shows. A '''backup dancer''' (or background dancer)  is a performer who dances with or behind the lead performers in a live musical act or in a music video.<ref name=\"www.tele\"></ref>", "paragraphs": [[[69, 33, 690, 2261], [359, 908, 33, 47, 261, 2261], [63, 30, 1835, 13, 12561, 5, 2155, 42, 273, 2261, 25, 201, 4119, 62, 363, 6, 1598, 5, 17688], [0, 85, 299, 3, 0, 2261], [9582, 58588], [], []], [[7764, 6586, 199, 2261, 75, 2261, 5, 1959, 2261], [21, 2261, 18, 1702, 2261, 42, 33, 84, 208, 683, 34, 3509, 22, 169, 0, 8747, 75, 7, 92, 3, 18582], [6, 37, 92, 0, 1914, 511, 6, 7, 26923, 5, 30, 456, 269, 3, 21, 44, 908, 7, 30, 10671, 21, 2943], [158, 2261, 30, 88, 13, 1192, 4979, 1880, 136, 10968, 4270, 46, 336, 5, 100, 13], [39, 30, 596, 6, 64, 199, 11305], [], [311], []], [[0, 1959, 2261, 2733, 4, 7764, 30, 4, 88, 17, 0, 85, 587, 0, 8747], [21, 26907, 7, 2694, 46, 4599, 0, 8747, 733, 18, 86, 3388, 7, 268, 5, 159, 20, 4699], [4, 2261, 6, 20299, 3, 0, 2694, 42, 30, 242, 4, 30, 3985, 30, 4, 399, 48, 17, 101], [4, 26907, 0, 743, 3, 1739, 30, 4, 2874, 13133], [37, 30, 0, 921, 3, 269, 561, 7, 1959, 2261], [7764, 389, 66, 12, 908, 3, 37, 921, 88, 36, 588, 1906, 0, 2540, 118, 1157, 5, 1261], [39, 588, 733, 0, 1959, 2261, 161], [0, 2261, 1554, 42, 30, 234, 6, 1959, 2261, 30, 311], []], [[0, 55, 1135, 3, 2261, 107, 30, 1429, 600], [13133, 2261, 107, 5273, 150, 21751, 92, 5, 38508], [0, 353, 8747, 71627, 234, 77, 3, 37, 1159, 6, 26, 18293, 10, 0, 6508], [2862, 89224, 4870, 62503], [0, 13496, 3, 1509, 7, 6508, 59, 0, 6627, 3, 7, 1749, 105, 7, 11305, 4618, 3, 1509]], [[6, 181, 397, 79, 0, 2261, 164, 53, 346, 59, 30, 310, 6, 6, 1035], [91, 300, 30, 1863, 207], [49, 787, 30, 1863, 317], [14774, 2261, 30, 683, 3, 1194, 2261], [14774, 2261, 125, 7, 0, 21766, 30, 88, 21, 1334]], [[207, 0, 589, 181, 14774, 2261, 30, 5707, 2261], [0, 179, 69, 483, 30, 394, 6, 208, 3530], [158, 3530, 30, 1140, 331, 46, 1249], [1402, 483, 22, 0, 215, 79, 5, 1624, 22, 0, 215, 79], [0, 403, 282, 10, 7, 208, 79, 5, 127, 837], [49, 0, 10569, 3, 0, 21766, 204, 170, 1135, 3, 2261], [], [2753, 256448], [2245, 2261], [4, 589], [2261, 1145], [6, 0, 21766, 5, 288, 2261, 69, 2261, 6, 1334, 34, 39, 88, 100, 5244], [39, 88, 36, 2261, 6, 3530, 34, 483, 469, 0, 927, 7, 39, 3832, 34, 811, 29421], [456, 50, 2261, 1135, 3704], [77, 2261, 7, 1426, 5244, 7, 39, 3832], [491, 2261, 30, 117, 12], [64, 37, 1554, 3, 2261, 33, 403]], [[22, 0, 215, 79, 469, 0, 85, 63, 30, 109, 1274, 2261], [77, 3, 101, 33, 30, 242, 10, 3079, 3, 62], [53, 580, 101, 55429, 2261]], [[0, 326, 3, 814, 403, 974, 5, 13664, 410, 4, 7, 921, 3, 8747, 1428, 253, 6, 77, 912, 273], [7, 6849, 8747, 46, 2093, 8747, 30, 7, 8874, 38, 2261, 17, 46, 561, 0, 410, 8874, 6, 7, 682, 2148, 743, 46, 6, 7, 403]]]}, {"title": "Styles", "text": "There are many different styles of dance, which fall into these general types:\n\n* Classic dance\n\n*Professional dancing\n**Ballet\n**Modern dance\n**Theatre dance\n**Belly dancing\n**Jazz dance\n**Tap dance\n\n*Social dancing\n**Ballroom dancing (International style) \n***Waltz\n***Foxtrot\n***Tango\n***Quickstep\n***Viennese waltz\n***Cha-cha-cha\n***Jive\n***Paso doble\n***Samba\n***Rumba\n**Other styles\n***Salsa\n***Rock and Roll\n**Street dance\n***Breakdancing\n***Funk\n***Hip hop\n\n*Folk dance\n**Irish Dance\n**Morris Dance\n**Country Dance\n\n*Indian Classical Dances\n**Bharat Natyam\n**Kathak\n**Mohini Attam\n**Kathakali\n**Kuchipudi", "paragraphs": [[[63, 30, 109, 494, 1135, 3, 2261, 42, 807, 75, 37, 216, 1554]], [[], [2392, 2261]], [[], [1162, 2261], [], [6508], [], [1194, 2261], [], [], [2496, 2261], [], [], [13174, 2261], [], [], [3281, 2261], [], [7053, 2261]], [[], [659, 2261], [], [], [14774, 2261, 146, 1135], [], [], [21766], [], [], [81537], [19322], [], [], [118398], [], [32081, 21766], [], [], [19450, 19450, 19450], [], [36032], [], [], [11836, 74834], [23671], [], [], [61213], [], [68, 1135], [], [], [17781], [], [], [1137, 5, 3301], [], [491, 2261], [], [127403], [], [], [12228], [], [], [4706, 6701]], [[], [5007, 2261], [], [1838, 2261], [], [4239, 2261], [123, 2261]], [[], [792, 4260, 11215], [], [33861, 166173], [], [102636], [], [94472, 385732], [], [93030], [], [166692]]]}, {"title": "Professional dancers", "text": "*Alvin Ailey \n*George Balanchine\n*Vernon and Irene Castle\n*Misty Copeland\n*Katherine Dunham\n*Bob Fosse\n*Loie Fuller\n*Gene Kelly\n*Vaslav Nijinsky\n*Margot Fonteyn\n*Monsieur Pierre\n*Antonio Ruiz Soler", "paragraphs": [[[], [16711, 54136], [649, 31845, 10587, 5, 15997, 3076], [26783, 26534], [11669, 26675, 1862, 39759], [11441], [4083, 3755], [173767, 71627], [], [31842, 105262], [37868, 5029, 2963, 11326, 51881]]]}, {"title": "References", "text": "<!-- interwiki -->", "paragraphs": [[[], []]]}]}

Dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons.\n\nThe books that Dutton wrote about Speedwords are not printed anymore. But Speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working online. For example, it makes it faster to type an email.\n\nAnother way of writing quickly is Pitman's shorthand. This uses special symbols instead of letters. Speedwords uses Roman letters. This makes it easier to learn. It also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard. Each word means only one thing.

{"title": "Devil", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "In some religions, the '''devil''' is a bad spirit or supernatural being that tries to create problems for people and distance them from God. Some people also use the words \"the Devil\" or \"Satan\" for the most powerful devil. The word \"devil\" comes from the Greek word \"diabolos\" which means \"someone who tells lies to hurt you\". (\"Diabolos\" is translated to the English word \"slanderer.\") The New Testament uses \"diabolos\" as a title for Satan, and so \"The Devil\" became another name for Satan in English.\n\nIn the Old Testament, there is the serpent and the '''shaitan''', who may be two different characters. \"Shaitan\" in Hebrew means \"adversary\", an enemy or opponent. Shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the Koran, who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing.<ref></ref>\n\nIn Christianity the Devil was originally an angel in heaven called Lucifer. But he wanted to be the ruler of heaven and so he revolted against God. After a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven. Some other angels who helped him were also thrown out.\n\nAfter the Devil was thrown out of heaven, he started doing bad things on the earth. He wants people to worship him instead of God. Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises.<ref></ref>\n\nThe other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons. They obey the Devil and help him do evil things.\n\nThe Book of Revelation says that God will punish the Devil and his demons by throwing them into a Lake of Fire that burns in Hell. This will happen in the future.\n\nArtists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil. But nobody knows what he may look like. Usually he is a spirit that nobody can see, but he can make himself look like a real person in order to trick people.

In 1397 Denmark, Sweden and Norway became a single country with one queen (this country was called the ''Kalmar Union'') Sweden became a separate country again in 1523. Denmark and Norway (called ''Denmark-Norway)'' stayed united, until 1814. Denmark-Norway controlled many islands in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland. Iceland became independent from Denmark in 1944.\n\n\nDenmark became a constitutional monarchy in June 5, 1849 when it adopted a constitution which took away powers from the King and gave rights to ordinary Danish people. June 5 is  now a holiday in Denmark, called \"Constitution Day\".\n\nOver the years Denmark lost many of the lands that it controlled in battle. Denmark's biggest war defeat was the ''Second Schleswig War'' (in 1864) when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein was conquered by the Kingdom Prussia (now a part of Germany). This was a big loss for Denmark and, consequently, it began a policy of neutrality after the loss, meaning it would no longer take part in any wars or support other countries. Denmark did not take part in the First World War.\n\nOn April 9, 1940, Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Nazis stayed in Denmark throughout World War II.

After the Germans were captured on May 9, 1945, the Soviet Army occupied the island until April 6, 1946.\n\nAfter World War Two, Denmark became a member of NATO and the European Union.

{"title": "Death", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Death''' is the end of life in an organism. All biological and living activity of the living thing stop, including the mind and the senses. The usual signal for death in humans and many other animals is that the heart stops beating and cannot be restarted. This can be caused by many things. All living things have a limited lifespan, and all living things eventually die.\n\nLiving things that have died are normally described as being '''dead'''. Death of humans is often investigated for the cause, in case of crime (such as murder), accident or disease that may continue to kill other humans. About 150,000 people die every day around the world.<ref name=degrey></ref> About two thirds of these people die because of age.<ref name=degrey/> In addition to the physical body, some believe humans also have a soul and believe that the soul can continue without a body (afterlife), move into another body (reincarnation), or cease to exist (annihilationism). Religions have different beliefs about this issue. Many cultures have their own customs and rituals to respect the dead.\n\nWhen people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal, those things or events are usually described as being deadly, or fatal. In the case of diseases, they are described as ''terminal''. Humans are no different from any other lifeform. Our bodies have an ability for self-repair, but that ability is limited. Finding the cause of death is a medical speciality called pathology. In medicine, death is when the heart stops beating for more than several minutes. There are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes, such as near-drowning in very cold water. If machines are used to help the heart and lungs work, then the moment of death is more difficult to know.", "paragraphs": [[[336, 30, 0, 156, 3, 214, 6, 7, 18181], [64, 4390, 5, 682, 1830, 3, 0, 682, 873, 837, 488, 0, 1676, 5, 0, 1380], [0, 3518, 3248, 10, 336, 6, 473, 5, 109, 68, 2694, 30, 12, 0, 1058, 837, 960, 5, 86, 36, 30, 10029], [37, 86, 30, 1157, 21, 109, 873], [64, 682, 873, 33, 7, 2514, 27172, 5, 64, 682, 873, 1181, 2357]], [[756, 873, 12, 33, 2357, 30, 3520, 4466, 7, 30, 767], [336, 3, 473, 30, 456, 3974, 10, 0, 1157, 6, 305, 3, 1340, 125, 7, 1475, 1960, 46, 1289, 12, 107, 660, 4, 1916, 68, 473], [59, 69, 2357, 359, 122, 204, 0, 311], [], [59, 55, 245, 3, 37, 69, 2357, 113, 3, 311], [], [6, 1072, 4, 0, 2183, 719, 77, 733, 473, 52, 33, 7, 4184, 5, 733, 12, 0, 4184, 86, 660, 296, 7, 719, 28103, 483, 75, 170, 719, 27818, 46, 3427, 4, 3604], [9847, 33, 494, 4440, 59, 37, 495], [109, 1295, 33, 44, 261, 7439, 5, 8343, 4, 1983, 0, 767]], [[61, 69, 1077, 59, 873, 46, 770, 12, 410, 4, 0, 336, 3, 7, 1189, 46, 2694, 12, 873, 46, 770, 30, 1140, 4466, 7, 30, 3132, 46, 5553], [6, 0, 305, 3, 1289, 39, 30, 4466, 7, 4711], [3790, 30, 84, 494, 25, 130, 68, 177593], [162, 719, 33, 7, 1657, 10, 1496, 4676, 34, 12, 1657, 30, 2514], [2300, 0, 1157, 3, 336, 30, 7, 749, 34762, 580, 20945], [6, 2350, 336, 30, 61, 0, 1058, 837, 960, 10, 181, 73, 201, 1214], [63, 30, 557, 79, 6, 42, 69, 4307, 151, 413, 0, 1058, 33, 837, 10, 1214, 125, 7, 355, 23344, 6, 191, 1866, 430], [83, 2358, 30, 234, 4, 275, 0, 1058, 5, 7136, 161, 127, 0, 1600, 3, 336, 30, 181, 1013, 4, 346]]]}, {"title": "Society and culture", "text": "Death is commonly a sad or unpleasant thing to people.

{"title": "Diesel-electric", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "A '''diesel-electric''' engine is a diesel generator, a diesel engine that drives an electric generator. The generator feeds electric power to an electric motor which turns a driveshaft.  Its efficiency is higher than when an engine drives a shaft through gears.  Most locomotives and many ships use diesel-electric drive.\n\nMany diesel-electric drives, especially small ones, store the electricity in a battery. Some designs also store braking energy in a flywheel, which can also charge a battery. However, these add even more complexity and weight to the vehicle, so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving.\n\nBecause they do not require any change or investment in stations nor much in vehicle design, diesel-electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today's internal combustion engine.

The second largest is the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', which is the largest one that is printed. Some languages have a larger printed encyclopedia and some have none.  Either kind of encyclopedia can inform us on many different topics.\n\nBook series were used to summarize all knowledge have been published for thousands of years.  A famous early one was the ''Natural History''\u00a0by Pliny the Elder. The name \"encyclopedia\" is from the 16th century and meant \"complete knowledge\". The French Encyclop\u00e9die of Denis Diderot was the first that had major parts written by many people from all around the world.\n\nAfter the printing press was invented, dictionaries with long definitions began to be called encyclopedias that were books that has articles or subjects. For example, a dictionary of science, if it included essays or paragraphs, it was thought of as an encyclopedia or knowledgeable book on the subject of science. Some encyclopedias then put essays on more than one subject in alphabetical order instead of grouping them together by subject. The word, encyclopedia, was put in the title of some encyclopedias. \n\nCompanies such as Britannica were started for the purpose of publishing encyclopedias for sale to individuals, and for public use in libraries.

The mass of the Earth pulls the gasses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space. The air is mostly made of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%) but there are a few other gasses as well.<ref></ref> Most living things need the air (or parts of the air gripped in the water) to breathe and live. They use the gasses&mdash;especially oxygen and carbon dioxide&mdash;to make and use sugar and to give themselves power.\n\nThe air animals and plants use to live is only the first level of the air around the Earth (the troposphere). The day to day changes in this level of air are named weather; the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the climate. Rain and storms are both in this level. Both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up. Cold air becomes thicker and falls, and warm air becomes thinner and goes up.<ref name = NASA></ref> The turning Earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the Earth generally gets more power from the Sun and is warmer than the north and south points. At the same time, air over water (specially very warm water) gets water in it but, because cold air is not able to take in as much water, it starts to make clouds and rain as it gets colder. The way water moves around in a circle like this is called the water cycle.<ref name= NASA />\n\nAbove this first level, there are four other levels. The air gets colder as it goes up in the first level; in the second level (the stratosphere), the air gets warmer as it goes up. This level has a special kind of oxygen called ozone. The ozone in this air keeps living things safe from damaging rays from the Sun. The power from these rays is what makes this level warmer and warmer. The middle level (the mesosphere) gets colder and colder with height; the fourth level (the thermosphere) gets warmer and warmer; and the last level (the exosphere) is almost outer space and has very little air at all. It reaches about half the way to the Moon. The three outer levels have a lot of electric power moving through them; this is called the ionosphere and is important for radio and other electric waves in the air. It is also where the Northern Lights are.\n\nEven though air seems very light, the weight of all of the air above the outside of the Earth (air pressure) is important. Generally, from sea level to the top of the outer level of the air, a space of air one square centimeter across has a mass of about 1.03 kg and a space of air one square inch across has a weight of about 14.7 pounds. The mass of the air also keeps the Earth safe when rocks (meteorites) hit it from outer space. Without the air, the damage meteorites do would be much greater. Because of the air, meteorites generally burn up long before they get to the earth.\n\nThe air also keeps the Earth warm, specially the half turned away from the Sun. Some gasses &ndash; especially methane and carbon dioxide &ndash; work like a blanket to keep things warm.<ref></ref> In the past, the Earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now. Since people have grown used to the heat we have now, though, we do not want the Earth to be too much warmer or colder. Most of the ways people create electric power use burning kinds of carbon&mdash;especially coal, oil, and natural gas. Burning these creates new carbon dioxide and can cause more warming. A large discussion is going on now about what people should do about the Earth's latest warming, which has gone on for about 150 years. So far, this warming has been good for people: plants have grown better and the weather has been better than when it was colder before.

They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When Einstein said that gravity could affect light, it took a few years before astronomers could test it. General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.<ref>Kennefick, Daniel 2005.

Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics.\n\nEthics is part of other fields of study in many ways. Here are some ways:\n\n* Ethics is part of the study of religion. In religion, people often learn what is good or bad from what they believe about God (or gods). Some important ideas about what is good or bad have come from religion. See Ten Commandments.\n* Some theories of economics say ethics has to do with money. Money is a big part of most people's lives. Thinking about morality can be important in economics. For example, there is a saying about ethics taken from the Bible that 'the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil' (1 Timothy).The philosophy of Marxism also says that a few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people.\n* Government policy can be affected by what politicians think is ethical. Politicians try to create laws that help everyone do what is right. Political debates happen when the people who make public policy do not agree about what is right.\n* In work, thinking about ethics can help with hard questions. Work can be like both economics and politics. Workers have to make money and follow laws. But the best way to do both is not always easy to know. The study of this is called business ethics\n* People like doctors and nurses have to make hard choices about how to care for people. Sometimes the person being cared for, their family or the doctor do not agree what is best for them. Also, choices have to be made if there are enough resources to help all. The study of this is called medical ethics. Similar studies for specific professions include bioethics and legal ethics.\n* Discussing ethics can also be a way to stop people fighting or starting a war. By talking about ethics, people hope to get what they want without being violent. This works when all people agree that peace is very important. But not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong. So, sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without fighting.\n\nAlong with aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology, the philosophy of what people like.", "paragraphs": [[[2842, 17502, 86, 275, 69, 2099, 102, 4, 88, 61, 39, 33, 1675], [109, 11296, 269, 12, 88, 1096, 46, 159, 130, 1675, 30, 7, 153, 3, 17502]], [[5321, 30, 153, 3, 68, 610, 3, 806, 6, 109, 179], [187, 30, 77, 179]], [[], [5321, 30, 153, 3, 0, 806, 3, 2830], [6, 2830, 69, 456, 2368, 102, 30, 219, 46, 978, 25, 102, 39, 733, 59, 1533, 46, 1533], [77, 481, 1159, 59, 102, 30, 219, 46, 978, 33, 326, 25, 2830], [253, 1705, 20966], [], [77, 2314, 3, 3674, 203, 17502, 33, 4, 88, 17, 308], [308, 30, 7, 365, 153, 3, 181, 69, 682], [2412, 59, 12912, 86, 30, 481, 6, 3674], [10, 880, 63, 30, 7, 203, 59, 17502, 190, 25, 0, 5489, 12, 0, 835, 3, 308, 30, 0, 5440, 3, 64, 921, 3, 4367], [4044, 3, 26620, 52, 203, 12, 7, 306, 69, 234, 308, 6, 0, 1797, 179, 86, 2088, 109, 68, 69], [], [78, 527, 86, 30, 3194, 21, 102, 2825, 269, 30, 8374], [2363, 841, 4, 1210, 264, 12, 275, 1402, 88, 102, 30, 248], [209, 1422, 1927, 61, 0, 69, 38, 159, 198, 527, 88, 36, 2137, 59, 102, 30, 248], [], [6, 161, 269, 59, 17502, 86, 275, 17, 605, 995], [161, 86, 30, 117, 150, 3674, 5, 51757], [537, 33, 4, 159, 308, 5, 1816, 264], [34, 0, 143, 179, 4, 88, 150, 30, 36, 690, 1673, 4, 346], [0, 806, 3, 37, 30, 580, 258, 17502], [], [69, 117, 2082, 5, 6794, 33, 4, 159, 605, 1675, 59, 197, 4, 757, 10, 69], [1071, 0, 899, 30, 757, 10, 44, 213, 46, 0, 2082, 88, 36, 2137, 102, 30, 143, 10, 101], [52, 1675, 33, 4, 30, 159, 83, 63, 30, 575, 5893, 4, 275, 64], [0, 806, 3, 37, 30, 580, 749, 17502], [793, 806, 10, 1902, 8104, 488, 5, 830, 17502], [5640, 17502, 86, 52, 30, 7, 179, 4, 837, 69, 838, 46, 465, 7, 136], [21, 1077, 59, 17502, 69, 824, 4, 169, 102, 39, 303, 296, 30, 2528], [37, 161, 61, 64, 69, 2137, 12, 349, 30, 191, 481], [34, 36, 1402, 2137, 59, 102, 30, 248, 46, 1797], [100, 1071, 3946, 86, 159, 20, 605, 4, 1077, 296, 838]], [[385, 17, 13801, 17502, 683, 153, 3, 0, 4044, 3, 102, 69, 117]]]}, {"title": "Related pages", "text": "* Conflict of interest\n* Utilitarianism\n* ''The Republic'', a book by Plato that says that people who have power should use ethics to make choices.\n* ''The Prince'', a book by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli that says that people who have power should not use ethics to make choices.", "paragraphs": [[[1302, 3, 560], [89252, 0, 874, 7, 539, 21, 22593, 12, 203, 12, 69, 38, 33, 268, 189, 234, 17502, 4, 159, 1675], [0, 1781, 7, 539, 21, 59062, 54666, 12, 203, 12, 69, 38, 33, 268, 189, 36, 234, 17502, 4, 159, 1675]]]}]}

This includes money, and the economic benefits (\"utility\") that you didn't get because you can no longer buy something else.This is called opportunity cost.\n* People react to encouragements (\"incentives\"). Making an option more attractive will make more people choose it.\n* Trade can make everyone better off.\n* Markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life. In the free market, goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions. The \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the market (Adam Smith) states that if everyone tries to get what they want, everyone will be as well-off as they could possibly be.\n* Sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society. For example, air pollution is bad for society, and education is good for society. The government can put a tax (or do something to reduce sales) on items that are bad for society. It can also support (like giving money for) items that are good for society.\n* The living standard of a country depends on the skills to produce services and goods.

In years immediately before common years, February finishes on the same day of the week as July of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, April and December of the following year.\n\nFebruary is also the only month of the calendar that, once every six years and twice every 11 years consecutively, either back into the past or forward into the future, will have four full 7-day weeks. In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday, in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday, this was observed in 2010 and can be traced back 11 years to 1999, 6 years back to 1993, 11 years back to 1982, 11 years back to 1971 and 6 years back to 1965, and will be observed in 2021.

This works unless the pattern is broken by a skipped leap year, but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100.\n\nFrom circa 700&nbsp;BC, when Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, added it to the calendar, February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year, until 46&nbsp;BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise. Leap year Day, February 29, is added in every year that can be divided equally by four, such as 2012 and 2016, but this does not apply when the year ending in \"00\" at the turn of the century does not divide equally into 400. This means that 1600 and 2000 were leap years in the Gregorian calendar, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were rather common years. This is where the Julian calendar calculated dates differently, as it always repeated February 29 every four years.\n\nFebruary is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere and a summer month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of August in the other. In weather lore, Groundhog Day, in the United States, is set to decide what the weather will be like for the rest of the winter.\n\nFebruary's flower is the violet and its birthstone is the amethyst. The meaning of the amethyst is sincerity.

{"title": "Fecund universes", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Fecund universes''' is a multiverse theory of Lee Smolin.  It relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly a theory of cosmology.\n\nIn this theory, collapsing stars, or black holes, are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics.  Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a mutation of the original universe, as if each universe was a kind of single-celled organism.  It would reproduce by \"splitting\" in some sense.\n\nThis theory relies on many models of our universe to model these \"mutated\" alternative universes, the ones that Smolin supposes are generated or \"spun off\" by black holes. \n\nNo human can ever be part of any of these \"other\" universes.  Observations from astrophysics can only say if the black holes exist or are common, and give some idea of how much the laws of physics can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes.  \n\nSmolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see, since they are likely in a very late born universe, by simple probability.  If there are many black holes, that is evidence for his theory, \n\nAs this shows, cosmology has a very different standard of evidence and burden of proof than is required for models of our universe only, which humans (using mathematics) can observe and exchange knowledge on.\n\nIt is hard to separate science from religion on such questions.  It may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see one's universe as part of a system like biology or like mechanics - clockwork.  Smolin's theory is important mostly because it challenges the mechanistic paradigm.  \n\nEven if it is wrong, it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all.

{"title": "Foot", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": ":''Foot is also the name of a unit of measurement. See foot (unit of length).\n\n\n\n\n\nA '''foot''' (one ''foot'', two or more '''feet''') is a body part on the end of a leg. It is used when walking. It is also important for balance: it helps people stand straight. People also use it to kick, in both fighting and sports, football being an example.\n\nPeople's hands and feet have the same shape: they both have five ''digits'' (the fingers and toes). Many other animals with backbones also have five digits. The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the ''heel''. The bottom of the foot is called the ''sole''. Half the bones in our body are in the foot. Doctors who work with people's feet are ''podiatrists'' or ''chiropodists''.\n\nMany animals have feet, and there are many different sorts of foot. The feet of monkeys are much like the hands. The hard foot of an ungulate is a hoof. When an animal has soft feet, or feet with soft parts on the underside, we often call it a ''paw''. \n\nMany people like to use footwear, especially outside. It has special names, for example ''sandals'', ''shoes'', and ''boots''.  When people always wear footwear, especially in hot places or when they are very active, their feet can smell badly (''foot odour)''.  Wearing footwear that is too big or small can be bad for the feet.  People who have foot, leg, and back problems can also get help from special shoes. \n\nPeople have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear. For example, in much of Europe and Canada, people usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home or visiting. In the United States people often wear shoes inside a home. In Japan, people do not wear shoes in homes, and floors are often made of very soft materials, too soft for shoes. In cultures where people always wear shoes, people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them. Not wearing shoes can be good for the feet, especially for children's feet.\n\nConditions like Athlete's foot affect the feet, causing the feet to feel dry and cracked.", "paragraphs": [[[2149, 30, 52, 0, 311, 3, 7, 1207, 3, 11654], [253, 2149, 1207, 3, 2653]], [], [], [[7, 2149, 48, 2149, 55, 46, 181, 2149, 30, 7, 719, 153, 13, 0, 156, 3, 7, 2231], [20, 30, 234, 61, 2385], [20, 30, 52, 481, 10, 2515, 20, 275, 69, 1346, 1362], [69, 52, 234, 20, 4, 3361, 6, 150, 838, 5, 1935, 535, 30, 7, 880]], [[69, 823, 5, 2149, 33, 0, 215, 3030, 39, 150, 33, 174, 9097], [0, 6474, 5, 10520], [109, 68, 2694, 17, 14133, 52, 33, 174, 9097], [0, 153, 3, 0, 2149, 42, 1429, 20, 4, 0, 2231, 30, 580, 0, 15310], [0, 2389, 3, 0, 2149, 30, 580, 0, 5153], [343, 0, 5226, 6, 162, 719, 30, 6, 0, 2149], [1768, 38, 161, 17, 69, 2149, 30, 102870, 46, 377552]], [[109, 2694, 33, 2149, 5, 63, 30, 109, 494, 2598, 3, 2149], [0, 2149, 3, 11408, 30, 181, 117, 0, 823], [0, 605, 2149, 3, 7, 162758, 30, 7, 41601], [61, 7, 2694, 33, 3338, 2149, 46, 2149, 17, 3338, 153, 13, 0, 22456, 53, 456, 580, 20, 7, 31877]], [[109, 69, 117, 4, 234, 18003, 858, 587], [20, 33, 557, 311, 10, 880, 55455, 8597, 5, 10002], [61, 69, 690, 3433, 18003, 858, 6, 1627, 241, 46, 61, 39, 30, 191, 1546, 44, 2149, 86, 9332, 3914, 2149, 69787], [2758, 18003, 12, 30, 317, 365, 46, 357, 86, 30, 978, 10, 0, 2149], [69, 38, 33, 2149, 2231, 5, 137, 747, 86, 52, 169, 275, 25, 557, 8597]], [[69, 33, 494, 2836, 6, 494, 153, 3, 0, 85, 10, 61, 4, 3433, 18003], [10, 880, 6, 181, 3, 525, 5, 774, 69, 1140, 88, 36, 3433, 44, 8597, 46, 10002, 6, 7, 163, 46, 528], [6, 0, 104, 112, 69, 456, 3433, 8597, 1038, 7, 163], [6, 361, 69, 88, 36, 3433, 8597, 6, 163, 5, 1583, 30, 456, 159, 3, 191, 3338, 1304, 317, 3338, 10, 8597], [6, 1295, 111, 69, 690, 3433, 8597, 69, 1071, 269, 20, 30, 978, 36, 4, 3433, 101], [36, 3433, 8597, 86, 30, 219, 10, 0, 2149, 858, 10, 964, 2149]], [[1124, 117, 5835, 2149, 3194, 0, 2149, 1157, 0, 2149, 4, 998, 5, 5182]]]}, {"title": "Bones", "text": "In a human foot, there are 26 bones.

These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the Middle Ages. They used fewer spices, and more herbs and creamy ingredients.\n\nTypical ingredients like roux and fish stock, and techniques such as marinading, and dishes such as ragout, were invented. Car\u00eame was an expert p\u00e2tissier (pastry-maker), and this is still a mark of French cooking. He developed basic sauces, his 'mother sauces'; he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire, based on the half-dozen mother sauces.\n\nFrench cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by Georges Auguste Escoffier (1846\u20131935). He was a genius at organisation. He worked out how to run large restaurants, as in a big hotel or a palace; how the staff should be organised; how the menu was prepared. He had methods for everything. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''Le Guide Culinaire'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Hotel in London, the H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris, and some of the greatest cruise ships.\n\nEscoffier, however, left out much of the culinary character to be found in the regions of France.\n\nGastro-tourism and the ''Guide Michelin'' helped to acquaint people with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside in the 20th century. Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country. Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles regionally and nationally.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> In the north of France, people often prefer to use butter to cook.

There was a communist revolution in Russia and after 1922 Russia was a part of the Soviet Union. There were communists in Finland too, who tried to create a revolution in Finland. This attempt at revolution caused the Finnish civil war. The communists lost the civil war, and Finland did not change its old capitalist system.\n\nStalin, who was the leader of the Soviet Union, did not like having a capitalist country as its neighbour. Stalin wanted Finland to become a communist state and be a part of the Soviet Union. The leaders of Finland refused: they wanted to stay independent. The Soviet Union sent many troops across the eastern border of Finland to try to make Finland join them, which resulted in the Winter War.  The Soviet Union eventually won, and took most of Karelia and other parts of Finland.\n\n \nAdolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany, and he wanted to invade the Soviet Union. Finland wanted to retrieve the areas that it had lost, so they joined the German invasion, which started with Operation Barbarossa in 1941. The Finnish part of the Second World War is called the Continuation War in Finland. However, Finland was not a fascist or an antisemitic country. Finns were interested in freedom rather than dictatorship.\n\nWhile Germany was losing the war, Finland had already progressed into the Soviet Union in order to regain the areas lost in the previous peace. Finland wanted to end the war with the Soviet Union, which resulted in peace. Once again Finland had to give up the areas they had conquered. This time, the peace with the Soviet Union made Finland and Germany enemies. Finns fought the Germans, and Germans retreated to Norway, burning down all of Lapland behind them. This is called the Lapland War.  Finland remained independent.\n\nAfter the war, many factories were built in Finland. Many people moved from farms to cities. At that time, big factories manufactured products like paper and steel. More and more people worked in more advanced jobs, like high technology.

Most European languages are rather similar.\n\nEnglish makes few changes to its word endings ('suffixes'). In the Italic or 'Romance' languages (such as French, Italian, and Spanish), word endings carry a lot of meaning. In English we have just a few: plurals and possessives (''John's'') are the most common. In our verbs we have dropped most endings except one: I love, you love, but ''she love'''s'''''. That final ''''s'''' is a remnant of Anglo-Saxon, which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense: walk'''ed''', walk'''ing'''.\n\nWord order is the other big difference. Romance languages normally put adjectives after the nouns to which they refer. For example, in English, a person may say ''I like fast cars'', but in Spanish, it is ''Me gustan los coches r\u00e1pidos''. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In German, verbs often come near the end of sentences (as: ''Die Katze hat die Nahrung gegessen.''), whereas in English we usually put them between subject and object, as: ''the cat has eaten the food''.", "paragraphs": [[[64, 1032, 33, 44, 261, 9336], [96, 291, 1032, 30, 871, 793]], [[711, 159, 306, 511, 4, 47, 1388, 1945, 22488], [6, 0, 48987, 46, 7196, 1032, 125, 7, 348, 1031, 5, 1141, 1388, 1945, 1619, 7, 530, 3, 1702], [6, 711, 53, 33, 120, 7, 306, 17525, 5, 46699], [279, 30, 0, 181, 861], [6, 162, 15224, 53, 33, 1560, 181, 1945, 2077, 48, 41, 835, 81, 835, 34, 67, 835], [12, 294], [30, 7, 22334, 3, 11697, 16793, 42, 33, 181, 22488], [20973, 88, 33, 1945, 42, 273, 511, 6, 6187]], [[1388, 460, 30, 0, 68, 365, 2333], [7196, 1032, 3520, 339, 26082, 49, 0, 19571, 4, 42, 39, 1910], [10, 880, 6, 711, 7, 899, 107, 203, 41, 117, 1605, 569, 34, 6, 1141, 20, 30], [285, 373394, 796, 381067], [0, 460, 3, 0, 1388, 33, 511, 83, 120, 0, 1388, 296, 0, 9336, 30, 10994, 75, 711, 20, 54, 1702, 4, 285, 39, 3832, 0, 569, 1605], [37, 30, 113, 1141, 5, 711, 33, 494, 1067, 59, 1388, 460], [6, 514, 15224, 456, 326, 355, 0, 156, 3, 2422, 7, 2357, 380745, 5625, 2357, 6137, 6, 711, 53, 1140, 339, 101, 118, 1698, 5, 4599, 7, 0, 5450, 33, 3623, 0, 565]]]}, {"title": "Changing language", "text": "Written grammar changes slowly but spoken grammar is more fluid.

For example, people who use the dialects called General American English and BBC English might say, ''I didn't do anything'', while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English or AAVE might say, ''I didn't do nothing''. London working class version: ''I ain't done nuffink!''  These are called ''double negatives'', and are found almost entirely in spoken English, and seldom written.\n\nThese differences are called dialects. The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live. Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English.

{"title": "GNU Free Documentation License", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "The '''GNU Free Documentation License''' ('''GNU FDL''' or simply '''GFDL''') is a copyleft license for open content such as software. It was made up by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU project. It was initially created for use with software documentation, but can be applied to other types of works as well, such as Wikipedia. \n\nAs a copyright license, the GFDL is a type of contract between the creator of a copyrightable work (such as a book, an encyclopedia article, a painting, or a piece of music) and anyone else who might want to use it. The GFDL is considered \"copyleft\" because the license is meant to make it easier to use and re-use the copyrighted work, not to restrict its use. \n\nIf a copyrightable work is released under the GFDL, the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce, distribute, or modify the work, as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the GFDL. Among the requirements of the GFDL are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the GFDL\u2014that is, once something is licensed as GFDL, it will always stay licensed as GFDL, and anything which uses it also is licensed as GFDL. (Because the license \"reproduces\" and stays with the work, this is sometimes called a \"viral\" license.)\n\nThe GFDL also says that in order to distribute or modify a work licensed with the GFDL, the re-user must give credit to any previous authors of the work, and include a list of changes they made to the work. \n\nFinally, any work licensed with the GFDL must contain, somewhere, the entire text of the license. This provision has been criticized, because it is not always easy to include an entire, long license with a copyrighted work. In a book, for example, it is easy to include one extra page with the license, but if the work is something like a song, or a photograph, it is not easy. \n\nThe GFDL has other requirements that are more complicated. For example, if part of the work is labeled as an \"invariant section,\" it cannot ever be removed or changed by someone using the work (\"invariant\" means \"does not change\"). \n\nWorks licensed under the GFDL may be included in with non-GFDL-licensed works only if it is clear which parts of the work are licensed as the GFDL. For example, in a book of poetry it would be easy to label some poems as licensed under the GFDL and some not licensed under it. But it would not be easy to label if part of a song was licensed as GFDL and the rest was not, so this would not be allowed. \n\nAny use of GFDL material which violates the terms of the GFDL is potentially copyright infringement.\n\nA number of online projects use the GFDL. An online project to license its content under the GFDL is Wikipedia.<ref></ref>\n\nThe GFDL has been criticized by many people who wish that it made it even easier for content to be re-used. Among the criticisms are that it is very hard to combine GFDL material with other copyleft licenses, that it is not always clear and easy to understand, and that some of its requirements, such as the \"invariant sections\", are not free at all.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 32816, 415, 11106, 3851], [32816, 219450, 46, 1481, 178643, 30, 7, 138610, 3851, 10, 310, 2768, 125, 7, 1516], [20, 30, 159, 60, 21, 0, 415, 1516, 1466, 96112, 10, 0, 32816, 716], [20, 30, 1844, 1210, 10, 234, 17, 1516, 11106, 34, 86, 30, 3515, 4, 68, 1554, 3, 161, 7, 219, 125, 7, 17617]], [[19, 7, 4786, 3851, 0, 178643, 30, 7, 1554, 3, 953, 118, 0, 8368, 3, 7, 219311, 161, 125, 7, 7, 539, 7, 13837, 1759, 7, 5309, 46, 7, 2365, 3, 403, 5, 1544, 1726, 38, 107, 303, 4, 234, 20], [0, 178643, 30, 1568, 138610, 113, 0, 3851, 30, 1702, 4, 159, 20, 1673, 4, 234, 5, 1765, 234, 0, 4786, 161, 36, 4, 9361, 47, 234]], [[83, 7, 219311, 161, 30, 713, 124, 0, 178643, 0, 8368, 3, 0, 161, 30, 203, 12, 1544, 1726, 107, 18984, 8649, 46, 14846, 0, 161, 7, 173, 7, 39, 1816, 7, 208, 3, 5902, 8329, 6, 0, 178643], [244, 0, 5902, 3, 0, 178643, 30, 12, 130, 50, 161, 1210, 25, 0, 929, 161, 30, 52, 3851, 124, 0, 178643, 12, 30, 442, 645, 30, 3851, 7, 178643, 20, 43, 690, 1087, 3851, 7, 178643, 5, 1096, 42, 234, 20, 52, 30, 3851, 7, 178643], [113, 0, 3851, 18984, 5, 1087, 17, 0, 161, 37, 30, 1071, 580, 7, 12857, 3851]], [[0, 178643, 52, 203, 12, 6, 460, 4, 8649, 46, 14846, 7, 161, 3851, 17, 0, 178643, 0, 1765, 4832, 390, 455, 1164, 4, 130, 771, 1715, 3, 0, 161, 5, 488, 7, 674, 3, 511, 39, 159, 4, 0, 161]], [[1229, 130, 161, 3851, 17, 0, 178643, 390, 3540, 5530, 0, 1452, 2829, 3, 0, 3851], [37, 5060, 33, 30, 10827, 113, 20, 30, 36, 690, 1673, 4, 488, 7, 1452, 173, 3851, 17, 7, 4786, 161], [6, 7, 539, 10, 880, 20, 30, 1673, 4, 488, 48, 2004, 2184, 17, 0, 3851, 34, 83, 0, 161, 30, 645, 117, 7, 813, 46, 7, 7852, 20, 30, 36, 1673]], [[0, 178643, 33, 68, 5902, 12, 30, 181, 17009], [10, 880, 83, 153, 3, 0, 161, 30, 3007, 7, 7, 33306, 1519, 20, 86, 36, 661, 30, 3028, 46, 511, 21, 1318, 234, 0, 161, 33306, 1702, 14219, 36, 511]], [[850, 3851, 124, 0, 178643, 107, 30, 488, 6, 17, 1337, 178643, 3851, 161, 91, 83, 20, 30, 706, 42, 153, 3, 0, 161, 30, 3851, 7, 0, 178643], [10, 880, 6, 7, 539, 3, 4580, 20, 54, 30, 1673, 4, 3007, 77, 6675, 7, 3851, 124, 0, 178643, 5, 77, 36, 3851, 124, 20], [34, 20, 54, 36, 30, 1673, 4, 3007, 83, 153, 3, 7, 813, 30, 3851, 7, 178643, 5, 0, 1033, 30, 36, 100, 37, 54, 36, 30, 949]], [[130, 234, 3, 178643, 1304, 42, 8388, 0, 570, 3, 0, 178643, 30, 4151, 4786, 13947]], [[7, 30355, 3, 1292, 716, 234, 0, 178643], [29, 1292, 716, 4, 3851, 47, 2768, 124, 0, 178643, 30], []], [[0, 178643, 33, 30, 10827, 21, 109, 69, 38, 3467, 12, 20, 159, 20, 151, 1673, 10, 2768, 4, 30, 1765, 234], [244, 0, 1961, 30, 12, 20, 30, 191, 605, 4, 6582, 178643, 1304, 17, 68, 138610, 3851, 12, 20, 30, 36, 690, 706, 5, 1673, 4, 1906, 5, 12, 77, 3, 47, 5902, 125, 7, 0, 33306, 1519, 30, 36, 415, 22, 64]]]}, {"title": "History", "text": "The GFDL was released in draft form for feedback in September 1999.<ref></ref> After revisions, version 1.1 was issued in March 2000, version 1.2 in November 2002, and version 1.3 in November 2008.

{"title": "Glass", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Glass''' is a hard material that can be made in many shapes.  It is usually transparent, but it can also be made in colours.  Glass is mainly made of silica; glass made of silica only is called silica glass. \n\nGlass used to make windows and bottles is a specific type called soda-lime glass, composed of about 75% silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), sodium oxide (Na<sub>2</sub>O) from sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), calcium oxide, also called lime (CaO), and several minor additives. \n\nBy changing the proportions, and adding different ingredients, many kinds of glass can be made. Coloured glass is made by adding small amounts of metal oxides. For example, a blue colour is given by tiny amounts of cobalt oxide.\n\nCrystal glass is made by adding lead and zinc oxides. It is not actually a crystal because all glass is a non-crystalline solid. Crystal glass is called cut glass if it has been cut by hand:\n:\" 'Cut glass' is glass that has been decorated entirely by hand by use of rotating wheels. Cuts are made in an otherwise completely smooth surface of the glass by workers holding and moving the piece against various sized metal or stone wheels\".<ref>American Cut Glass Association. </ref>\n\nBecause glass is used to make lenses, the word \"glasses\" means eyeglasses.\n\nThe myth that glass is actually a liquid comes from the fact that old windows in houses and churches (200\u2013300 years old) are sometimes a little out of shape: thicker at the bottom than the top.  This is actually due to the process of glass making in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one edge than the other.  It was sensible to install the windows with the thick edge at the bottom.  Sometimes a window can be found with the thick edge at the top of the window.\n\nGlass can be recycled over and over. Glass bottles and jars can easily be recycled to make new glass bottles and jars or used in industry as aggregate (building material) or sand.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Roman diatretglas.jpg|Roman glass beaker from the 4th century A.D.\nImage:Glas halbvoll.JPG|A glass with water.\nImage:Chartres2006 046.jpg|Stained glass windows in a Christian church.\n</gallery>", "paragraphs": [[[2847, 30, 7, 605, 1304, 12, 86, 30, 159, 6, 109, 3030], [20, 30, 1140, 8858, 34, 20, 86, 52, 30, 159, 6, 8237], [2847, 30, 1674, 159, 3, 37198, 2847, 159, 3, 37198, 91, 30, 580, 37198, 2847]], [[2847, 234, 4, 159, 3453, 5, 6676, 30, 7, 1902, 1554, 580, 12714, 13056, 2847, 20820, 3, 59, 8272, 8107, 113524, 9503, 16049, 6182, 4868, 25, 9503, 30835, 6182, 1644, 14183, 16049, 52, 580, 13056, 12266, 5, 201, 2092, 27027]], [[21, 511, 0, 7603, 5, 1679, 494, 12682, 109, 921, 3, 2847, 86, 30, 159], [17172, 2847, 30, 159, 21, 1679, 357, 1418, 3, 2427, 16049], [10, 880, 7, 1185, 8237, 30, 455, 21, 3293, 1418, 3, 26297, 16049]], [[6164, 2847, 30, 159, 21, 1679, 410, 5, 14080, 16049], [20, 30, 36, 1403, 7, 6164, 113, 64, 2847, 30, 7, 1337, 30297, 3051], [6164, 2847, 30, 580, 611, 2847, 83, 20, 33, 30, 611, 21, 823, 611, 2847, 30, 2847, 12, 33, 30, 24504, 3462, 21, 823, 21, 234, 3, 20655, 4877], [1710, 30, 159, 6, 7, 2751, 2215, 5222, 2283, 3, 0, 2847, 21, 3219, 802, 5, 483, 0, 2365, 98, 917, 1275, 2427, 46, 2155], [140, 611, 2847, 640], [], []], [[113, 2847, 30, 234, 4, 159, 248758, 0, 1388, 2847, 1702, 90225]], [[0, 9687, 12, 2847, 30, 1403, 7, 6035, 326, 25, 0, 853, 12, 167, 3453, 6, 166, 5, 512, 62, 167, 30, 1071, 7, 333, 66, 3, 3030, 4950, 22, 0, 2389, 73, 0, 220], [37, 30, 1403, 445, 4, 0, 546, 3, 2847, 159, 6, 0, 341, 42, 410, 4, 0, 2847, 49039, 30, 4950, 22, 48, 2210, 73, 0, 68], [20, 30, 14237, 4, 7917, 0, 3453, 17, 0, 4950, 2210, 22, 0, 2389], [1071, 7, 3453, 86, 30, 596, 17, 0, 4950, 2210, 22, 0, 220, 3, 0, 3453]], [[2847, 86, 30, 30563, 74, 5, 74], [2847, 6676, 5, 16720, 86, 2407, 30, 30563, 4, 159, 50, 2847, 6676, 5, 16720, 46, 234, 6, 459, 7, 8034, 1190, 1304, 46, 5165]], [[3911], [1959, 1956, 2847, 68597, 25, 0, 589, 1959], [53610], [2847, 17, 430], [1959], [2847, 3453, 6, 7, 1377, 512], [], [], []]]}, {"title": "References", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Other websites", "text": "* Corning Museum of Glass\n* A comprehensive guide to art glass and crystal around the world\n* Working Description Furnace & Moleria - Murano Glass\n* Informative website about the glass industry\n* Substances used in the Making of Colored Glass\n* Almost 400 articles and images about glass (mostly art glass)", "paragraphs": [[[], [20270, 1133, 3, 2847], [], [7, 3782, 3372, 4, 760, 2847, 5, 6164, 204, 0, 85], [500, 3925, 18852, 67596, 2847], [28749, 2557, 59, 0, 2847, 459], [9181, 234, 6, 0, 433, 3, 7061, 2847, 591, 1759, 5, 1959, 59, 2847, 1246, 760, 2847]]]}]}

Within Christian canon the Old Testament talks about \"God the Father\", whilst the   New Testament is about Jesus, or \"God the Son\". Many Christians believe that Jesus was God's incarnation on Earth. Christians consider the  Holy Spirit to be God as well, the third person of God.\n\nIn the New Testament, there are three beings who are said to be God in different forms: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (also known as the Holy Ghost). This is called the Holy Trinity. Although the word \"Trinity\" is not in the Bible, the word used for God in chapter one of Genesis is actually plural, and the phrase \"in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit' is used in the New Testament, (e.g. Matthew 28:19). Another word that Christians believe has exactly the same meaning as \"Trinity\" is the word \"Godhead\", which ''is'' in the Holy Bible. \n\nChristians believe that God incarnated in a human body, through the normal birth process, normally growing up into a man named Jesus or (Yeshua), coming to Earth specifically to give every person an opportunity of salvation from their own evil, called sin. The effect of personal evil far transcends the repercussions humans cause to one another in the world, but affects one's relationship with God the Father, and that aspect of the self cannot be addressed through one's own self-improvement efforts, but requires God to intervene in order to set one right. When Jesus prayed and talked to God, he called him \"Father,\" and taught others to do the same.\n\nJesus also taught that one must be born again in order to receive God's Spirit, otherwise one remains separated from God, acting merely from their own mind, thus being vulnerable to deception by human philosophies or the many spiritual philosophies which do not come from God but from Fallen angels, which are within various false religions. After a person consciously accepts the free gift of eternal life, which Jesus's sacrifice offers, God comes to live in the individual, as God lived in humankind before the Fall.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 1377, 2677, 5489, 1077, 59, 1533, 6, 494, 179], [425, 1377, 9579, 0, 167, 9068, 1077, 59, 1533, 0, 629, 7023, 0, 50, 9068, 30, 59, 3993, 46, 1533, 0, 630], [109, 1377, 733, 12, 3993, 30, 1533, 16074, 13, 1828], [1377, 1568, 0, 2677, 2943, 4, 30, 1533, 7, 219, 0, 314, 899, 3, 1533]], [[6, 0, 50, 9068, 63, 30, 87, 134, 38, 30, 203, 4, 30, 1533, 6, 494, 683, 0, 629, 0, 630, 5, 0, 2677, 2943, 52, 346, 7, 0, 2677, 7431], [37, 30, 580, 0, 2677, 8297], [376, 0, 1388, 8297, 30, 36, 6, 0, 5489, 0, 1388, 234, 10, 1533, 6, 3923, 48, 3, 13617, 30, 1403, 17525, 5, 0, 6287, 6, 0, 311, 3, 0, 629, 630, 5, 2677, 2943, 30, 234, 6, 0, 50, 9068, 4770], [170, 1388, 12, 1377, 733, 33, 2796, 0, 215, 1702, 7, 8297, 30, 0, 1388, 92213, 42, 30, 6, 0, 2677, 5489]], [[1377, 733, 12, 1533, 53643, 6, 7, 473, 719, 131, 0, 1973, 2607, 546, 3520, 2274, 60, 75, 7, 300, 311, 3993, 46, 143541, 326, 4, 1828, 3565, 4, 455, 359, 899, 7, 1539, 3, 10532, 25, 44, 261, 4367, 580, 8161], [0, 1261, 3, 894, 4367, 372, 32022, 0, 101202, 473, 1157, 4, 48, 170, 6, 0, 85, 34, 3194, 48, 1483, 17, 1533, 0, 629, 5, 12, 6395, 3, 0, 1496, 86, 36, 30, 1476, 131, 48, 261, 1496, 3598, 968, 34, 2324, 1533, 4, 7912, 6, 460, 4, 208, 48, 248], [61, 3993, 8310, 5, 1077, 4, 1533, 18, 580, 103, 629, 5, 5293, 68, 4, 88, 0, 215]], [[3993, 52, 5293, 12, 48, 390, 30, 3045, 378, 6, 460, 4, 1653, 1533, 2943, 2751, 48, 944, 1350, 25, 1533, 743, 4544, 25, 44, 261, 1676, 1580, 30, 4590, 4, 15843, 21, 473, 4044, 46, 0, 109, 4289, 4044, 42, 88, 36, 326, 25, 1533, 34, 25, 3284, 5239, 42, 30, 425, 917, 3523, 2830], [49, 7, 899, 24254, 1863, 0, 415, 4130, 3, 11822, 214, 42, 3993, 6627, 901, 1533, 326, 4, 682, 6, 0, 1426, 7, 1533, 682, 6, 29373, 106, 0, 807]]]}, {"title": "God in Eastern religions", "text": "In Hinduism, there is only one God, named Brahman, but Brahman is said to have taken on many different incarnations.

Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. Democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people. \n\nHowever, many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters. One of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament, or limit the parties access to mass media such as television.

This may be as small as a community or village or as big as a continent (like Australia and India). \n\nThe people who rule can allow others to own land. It is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission. This view is called libertarianism. Others think they can do without government. This view is called anarchism. \n\nAlmost every place on Earth is connected to one and only one government. Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules, small border disputed areas and the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every other place on Earth there is a government that claims 'sovereign control' over it. The word \"sovereign\" is old and means \"control by a King\" (sovereign). Governments of villages, cities, counties and other communities are subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist, and then to that of the country.\n\nIt is from Kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation states came. The capital of a country, for instance, is where the King kept his assets. From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics. A government may regulate trade as well as to rule over land.\n\nGovernments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish.

Galaxies may contain many multiple star systems, star clusters, and various interstellar clouds. The Sun is one of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy; the Solar System includes the Earth and all the other objects that orbit the Sun.\n\nStar clusters are not galaxies, they are inside galaxies. Globular clusters are spherical-shaped star clusters which are part of the outer halo of the Milky Way. One of the largest (and oldest) known star clusters, Messier 15, has several million stars, packed closely together, with a black hole at its centre. The stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count, but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies. \n\nWithin galaxy clusters, galaxies move relative to other galaxies. They can and do collide. When this happens, the stars generally move past each other, but gas clouds and dust interact, and can form a burst of new stars. Gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.\n\n\n\nMany galaxies continue to form new generations of stars. The Milky Way, and all spiral shaped galaxies like it (see right side image of NGC 2997), produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year. This star formation happens in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1% to 10% of the mass of these galaxies. Globular star clusters, on the other hand, are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up. \n\nIn the astronomical literature, the word 'Galaxy' with a capital ''G'' is used for our galaxy, the Milky Way. The billions of other galaxies are written as 'galaxy' with a lowercase ''g''. The term ''Milky Way'' first came out in the English language in a poem by Chaucer.\n\n\nWhen William Herschel wrote his catalogue of deep sky objects, he used the name ''spiral nebula'' for objects like the Andromeda Galaxy. 200 years later astronomers discovered that they are made of stars as the Milky Way is, so the term 'nebula' is now only used for diffuse structures within a galaxy.", "paragraphs": [[[63, 30, 8403, 3, 494, 1275], [3682, 8403, 1006, 25, 15389, 17, 7, 306, 7, 1705, 93, 29126, 311], [], [], [], [753, 60, 4, 1752, 17, 7, 3079, 3282, 29126, 311], [311], [54327, 54327, 279, 6809], [], [25141, 3, 426, 8403, 10334, 22, 13338, 13, 0, 8512, 3, 4041, 50, 196, 246], [14868], [], [753, 64, 6960, 0, 8403, 313, 3, 1329], [19564, 107, 3540, 109, 2801, 753, 278, 753, 8512, 5, 917, 33962, 6237], [0, 1662, 30, 48, 3, 0, 753, 6, 0, 25293, 179, 8403, 0, 4708, 278, 488, 0, 1828, 5, 64, 0, 68, 4599, 12, 6960, 0, 1662]], [[753, 8512, 30, 36, 8403, 39, 30, 1038, 8403], [55505, 8512, 30, 24828, 3030, 753, 8512, 42, 30, 153, 3, 0, 6645, 21247, 3, 0, 25293, 179], [48, 3, 0, 426, 5, 167, 346, 753, 8512, 16324, 33, 201, 93, 753, 5158, 2400, 600, 17, 7, 521, 2924, 22, 47, 1437], [0, 753, 30, 317, 2400, 5158, 4, 169, 7, 5697, 2428, 34, 20, 2032, 33, 181, 753, 73, 77, 3, 0, 357, 8403]], [[425, 8403, 8512, 8403, 483, 4029, 4, 68, 8403], [39, 86, 5, 88, 23753], [61, 37, 1927, 0, 753, 1573, 483, 341, 236, 68, 34, 851, 6237, 5, 6211, 12574, 5, 86, 683, 7, 6305, 3, 50, 753], [9023, 2933, 150, 8403, 75, 3779, 50, 3030, 683, 2069, 2930, 46, 6780, 117, 1972]], [], [[109, 8403, 660, 4, 683, 50, 2064, 3, 753], [0, 25293, 179, 5, 64, 11182, 3030, 8403, 117, 20, 253, 248, 437, 1959, 3, 36197, 1711, 50, 753, 22, 7, 571, 3, 48, 46, 55, 753, 532, 62], [37, 753, 3530, 1927, 6, 0, 3083, 33962, 6237, 12, 1530, 10, 59, 4, 3, 0, 1329, 3, 37, 8403], [55505, 753, 8512, 13, 0, 68, 823, 30, 36, 839, 683, 753, 113, 37, 1830, 1927, 160, 3, 62, 363, 5, 127, 837, 442, 64, 3, 0, 851, 5, 6211, 6237, 30, 234, 60]], [[6, 0, 14363, 3290, 0, 1388, 8403, 17, 7, 351, 3410, 30, 234, 10, 162, 8403, 0, 25293, 179], [0, 160, 3, 68, 8403, 30, 2432, 7, 8403, 17, 7, 64251, 3410], [0, 570], [25293, 179, 326, 66, 6, 0, 711, 1032, 6, 7, 6675, 21, 42644]], [[61, 1074, 39783, 2432, 26, 13257, 3, 1479, 3505, 4599, 18, 234, 0, 311, 11182, 32775, 10, 4599, 117, 0, 43719, 8403], [62, 288, 17369, 6314, 12, 39, 30, 159, 3, 753, 7, 0, 25293, 179, 30, 100, 0, 570, 32775, 30, 114, 91, 234, 10, 28368, 1972, 425, 7, 8403]]]}, {"title": "Types", "text": "There are two main kinds of galaxies, spiral galaxy and elliptical galaxy.

(Its name changed to Kaliningrad in 1946). The town is on the river Pregel. There is an island in the river. There are some bridges across the river. Euler wanted to walk around and use each of the bridges once. He asked if he could do this. In 1736, he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible. Today, this problem is known as the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg.

They lived in all parts of Australia. Their lives were simple, they had very few needs. They lived by hunting, fishing and gathering.\n\nAborigines invented tools like the boomerang and spear, but did not farm (to be confirmed). Tradition was very important in their lives. Their religion is called the Dreamtime, which has lots of stories about the creation of the world by spirits. Aboriginal art started at least 30,000 years ago and there are lots of Dreaming stories painted on walls and cut in rocks all around Australia. Aboriginal music has songs about the Dreamtime, sometimes with special instruments like the didgeridoo.\n\nIn 1606 the first European, Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon (1571\u20131639), visited the west. Luis Vaez de Torres sailed through the water between Australia and Papua New Guinea later that year.\nOnly after Dirk Hartog chanced upon the west coast in 1616 did other European vessels visit and map the coast. After sixty more ships visited the coast, enough was known for a map to be published in 1811. The land was dry because of not much rain; some was a desert. The explorers thought no crops could be grown and so it would be difficult for people to live there. They decided there would be no economic reasons to stay.\n\nIn 1642, Dutchman Abel Tasman, working for the Dutch East Indies Company reached Tasmania, which he called Antony van Diemenslandt. He then called the continent he charted the north coast of on his second visit in 1644 New Holland. In 1688, William Dampier became the first '''Englishman''' to reach Australia.

Britain needed a place to send its convicts (people who had been sent to jail for theft and other crimes) because its gaols were full and it had just lost its American colonies in the American War of Independence. In 1788 the British First Fleet of 11 ships, carrying about 1500 people arrived at Botany Bay (Sydney). Arthur Phillip led them as the first Governor of New South Wales. About 160 000 convicts were brought to Australia from 1788 until 1868. Free immigrants began arriving in the 1790s.<ref name=\"dfat.gov.au\"/>\n\nFor the first few years they did not have much food, and life was very hard. But soon they began to farm, and more people came. Sydney grew, and new towns were started. Wool brought good money. By 1822, many towns had been set up and people from the towns often visited Sydney for additional economic resources.\n\nSoon people from Sydney found other parts of Australia. George Bass and Matthew Flinders sailed south to Tasmania and a colony was started at Hobart in 1803. Hamilton Hume and William Hovell went south from Sydney by land. They found the Murray River, and good land in Victoria. Thomas Mitchell went inland, and found more rivers. In 1826, the first British military outpost was set up at King George Sound in Western Australia. The Swan River Colony was started in 1829, with townsites at Fremantle and Perth. In 1836, a free-settler colony was started in South Australia, where no convicts were ever sent. Queensland became a separate colony in 1859. As the towns and farms spread across Australia, the Aboriginal people were pushed off their land. Some were killed, and many died from illness and hunger. Soon, Australia's Aborigines were outnumbered by Europeans, and many were made to live on reserves.\n\nThe goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people very rich.\n\nConvict transportation ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and self-govern. The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. The New South Wales Legislative Council, was created in 1825 to advise the Governor of New South Wales, but it was not chosen by voters. William Wentworth established the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand democratic government for New South Wales. In 1840, the Adelaide City Council and the Sydney City Council were started and some people could vote for them (but only men with a certain amount of money). Then, Australia's first parliamentary elections were held for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. ''The Australian Colonies Government Act'' [1850] allowed constitutions for New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.<ref>The Right to Vote in Australia \u2013 Australian Electoral Commission</ref> In 1850 elections for legislative councils were also held in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Australia\u2019s major electoral developments Timeline: 1788 \u2013 1899 \u2013 Australian Electoral Commission</ref>\n\nIn 1855, limited self-government was granted by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. A new secret ballot was introduced in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia in 1856, allowing people to vote in private. This system was copied around the world. In 1855, the right to vote was given to all men over 21 in South Australia.

After that, Ireland became covered with trees. The first people came to Ireland about 9,000 years ago, in the Middle Stone Age (Mesolithic period). They were nomadic. Once food ran out in the place they lived, they would move to another place. Evidence of these people was found in Mount Sandel, Co. Derry.\n\nAbout 4000&nbsp;BC, in the New Stone Age (Neolithic period), the first farmers arrived in Ireland. These people cleared openings in the forest and built permanent settlements with houses and farmland. When people in this age died, they were buried in tombs called megaliths. Many megaliths are left standing today, such as portal dolmens and passage tombs. The most famous megalith is Newgrange passage tomb in co. Meath.\n\nNew settlers came around 2000BC, marking the start of the Bronze Age. Copper was mined mainly in Mount Gabriel, co. Cork, and tin was imported from Cornwall. These people used bronze to make weapons, such as swords. They also used it to make early forms of jewellery, such as sun discs and torcs. These settlers buried the dead in court tombs or wedge tombs, and burial places have been found with stone circles.\n\nIt is unknown when the Celts came to Ireland, but it is likely they brought the use of iron with them. The use of iron marks the start of the Iron Age. It is known that by about 300BC, the use of iron and Celtic culture was widespread in Ireland. The Celts lived in ring forts, hill forts, promontory forts and crann\u00f3gs. It is thought that only the richer families and settlements lived in crann\u00f3gs. These were man-made islands in the middle of lakes with houses on them.\n\nCeltic Ireland was split into around 150 kingdoms called tuath. The king was elected from the royal family. Below the king were the Nobles, and the Aos D\u00e1na, who were people with special skills, such as poets, Druids (priests), judges and craftsmen.\n\nBy the early 6th century, Ireland was mostly Christian through the work of St. Patrick and other missionaries. Druids were replaced by priests and monks. Monasteries soon were built such as Glendalough in co. Wicklow. Glendalough and other monasteries built round towers for safety when Vikings attacked. Small monasteries were also built in remote places, the most famous being Skellig Michael, off the coast of co. Kerry.\n\nAt this time many hand-written manuscripts were created by the monasteries. They include the Cathach, the Book of Durrow, and the Book of Kells. Monks also produced fine silver chalices, croziers and brooches, and carved high crosses.\n\nIn 1169, Anglo-Norman lords invaded Ireland. They were led by Strongbow. He landed at Passage, Co. Waterford. The Anglo-Normans conquered many parts of Ireland the following 60 years. They introduced their way of life. The feudal system was soon introduced in Ireland as means of organising land. Castles were built to defend the land like Trim Castle, co. Meath. During the Middle Ages, Ireland's first proper towns were built.\n\nFrom 1801 until 1922, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1921 Northern Ireland was created and 'partitioned' from the south. Northern Ireland has stayed within the United Kingdom since then. The full name of the UK is 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'.\n\nIn 1922 the south became the Irish Free State.

He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state.\n\nIn 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi took control of Sicily, creating the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.<ref name=Encarta /> Vittorio Emanuele II was made the King. But, in 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were ruled by the Pope and Austrian Empire.\n\nVeneto was made part of Italy in 1866 after a war with Austria, and Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870. That was when they took away the Pope's power. The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep Catholic people from being active in politics. That year, Italy finally came back together.\n\nItaly participated in World War I as an ally of Great Britain, France, and Russia against the Central Powers. Almost all of Italy's fighting was on the Eastern border, near Austria. After the \"Caporetto defeat\", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers surrendered, and Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria.\n\nIn 1922, a new Italian government started. It was ruled by Benito Mussolini, the leader of Fascism in Italy. He became Head of Government and dictator, calling himself \"duce\" - which means \"leader\" in Italian. He became friends with German dictator Hitler. Germany, Japan and Italy became the Axis Powers and entered World War II together in 1940 against France, Great Britain, and later the Soviet Union. During the war, Italy controlled most of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nOn July 25, 1943, Mussolini was removed by the Great Council of Fascism, and, on September 8, 1943, Badoglio said that the war as an ally of Germany was ended. Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK, but Italian soldiers did not know who to shoot. In Northern Italy, a movement called Resistenza started to fight against the German invaders.\n\nMussolini tried to make another Northern Italian fascist state, the Republic of Sal\u00f2, but it failed. On April 25, 1945, Italy became free. The state became a republic on June 2, 1946, and, for the first time, women were able to vote. Italian people ended the Savoia dynasty and adopted a republic government.\n\nIn February 1947, Italy signed a peace treaty with the Allies losing all the colonies and some territorial areas (Istria and parts of Dalmatia).\n\nSince then Italy has joined NATO and the European Community (as a founding member), becoming one of the seven biggest industrial economies in the world.", "paragraphs": [[[106, 931, 30, 36, 7, 92], [0, 237, 30, 159, 3, 7, 129, 3, 920, 92, 1067, 21, 68, 123, 125, 7, 2640, 387, 5, 1029], [6, 0, 0, 5084, 3, 55426, 98017, 30, 0, 362, 3, 78, 3, 0, 92, 3, 23465], [18, 1077, 4, 0, 4009, 6, 29309, 5, 36070, 5, 203, 39, 189, 1210, 7, 529, 1031, 92], [37, 1927, 34, 68, 323, 5, 482, 1031, 92, 52, 1429, 19586, 4, 1210, 7, 365, 92]], [[6, 14051, 36866, 190, 424, 3, 12213, 1210, 0, 1859, 3, 931, 6, 311], [71652], [31431, 47203, 819, 30, 159, 0, 691], [34, 6, 86181, 5, 36070, 30, 149, 36, 153, 3, 931, 113, 39, 30, 1067, 21, 0, 2216, 5, 4009, 2552]], [[36070, 30, 159, 153, 3, 931, 6, 49, 7, 136, 17, 2640, 5, 1031, 2481, 320, 86181, 6], [12, 30, 61, 39, 190, 420, 0, 2216, 268], [0, 2216, 38, 30, 3400, 203, 12, 18, 30, 7, 5031, 4, 578, 1538, 69, 25, 30, 1546, 6, 51757], [12, 62, 931, 1229, 326, 137, 600]], [[931, 3093, 6, 85, 136, 41, 7, 7, 3658, 3, 353, 695, 387, 5, 412, 98, 0, 323, 2163], [591, 64, 3, 931, 838, 30, 13, 0, 828, 718, 355, 2640], [49, 0, 191858, 1841, 931, 269, 39, 54, 1895, 0, 136], [34, 6, 0, 323, 2163, 5157, 5, 931, 1885, 0, 62947, 139, 30025, 42, 442, 30, 261, 21, 2640]], [[6, 7, 50, 1031, 78, 465], [20, 30, 1067, 21, 23064, 21470, 0, 329, 3, 20978, 6, 931], [18, 399, 362, 3, 78, 5, 6498, 580, 670, 69649, 42, 1702, 329, 6, 1031], [18, 399, 1409, 17, 514, 6498, 6540], [509, 361, 5, 931, 399, 0, 8906, 2163, 5, 2322, 85, 136, 819, 600, 6, 98, 387, 353, 695, 5, 288, 0, 1332, 354], [105, 0, 136, 931, 424, 181, 3, 0, 4878, 937]], [[13, 375, 21470, 30, 3028, 21, 0, 353, 382, 3, 20978, 5, 13, 441, 132519, 203, 12, 0, 136, 7, 7, 3658, 3, 509, 30, 156], [931, 465, 838, 7, 7, 3658, 3, 387, 5, 0, 2046, 34, 1031, 2481, 88, 36, 346, 38, 4, 4088], [6, 529, 931, 7, 926, 580, 398254, 465, 4, 838, 98, 0, 514, 45397]], [[21470, 841, 4, 159, 170, 529, 1031, 14044, 92, 0, 874, 3, 163760, 34, 20, 4355], [13, 396, 931, 399, 415], [0, 92, 399, 7, 874, 13, 344, 5, 10, 0, 79, 787, 30, 667, 4, 538], [1031, 69, 156, 0, 112270, 5037, 5, 5045, 7, 874, 78]], [[6, 617, 931, 1100, 7, 349, 1782, 17, 0, 2186, 1895, 64, 0, 4717, 5, 77, 5560, 237, 57027, 5, 153, 3, 40762]], [[108, 127, 931, 33, 1429, 945, 5, 0, 291, 501, 7, 7, 238, 393, 399, 48, 3, 0, 438, 365, 1271, 427, 6, 0, 85]]]}, {"title": "Transportation", "text": "The railway network in Italy totals 16,627 kilometres (10,331&nbsp;mi), the 17th longest in the world.

{"title": "Idiom", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "An '''idiom''' is a common word or phrase which means something different from its literal meaning but can be understood because of their popular use. \n\nBecause idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly. Some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times. The idiom ''shape up or ship out'', which is like saying ''improve your behavior or leave if you don't'', might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee, but not to other people.\n\nIdioms are not the same thing as slang. Idioms are made of normal words that have a special meaning known to almost everyone. Slang is usually special words, or special meanings of normal words that are known only to a particular group of people.\n\nTo learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language, and how and when to use them. But people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings. In order to understand an idiom, one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from.\n\nTo know the history of an idiom can be useful and interesting, but is not necessary to be able to use the idiom properly.  For example, most native British English speakers know that \"No room to swing a cat\" means \"there was not much space\" and can use the idiom properly.

Evolution of the imune system: past, present and future. In Janeway C.A; Travers P; Walport M. & Shlomchik M. 2011. ''Immunobiology: the immune system in health and disease''. 5th ed, Garland, New York. 597611 </ref> These toll-like receptors can recognise bacteria as 'foreign', and are the starting-point for immune reactions. The type of immunity which is triggered by the toll-like receptors is called innate immunity. This is because it is entirely inherited in our genome, and is fully working as soon as our tissues and organs are properly developed.\n\nVertebrates, ''and only vertebrates'', have a second type of immunity. This is called adaptive immunity, because it 'remembers' previous infections. Then, if the same infection occurs again, the reaction is much stronger and faster. This immunological memory \"confers a tremendous survival advantage\" and with it vertebrates \"can survive over a long lifetime in a pathogen-filled environment\".<ref name=Janeway/>", "paragraphs": [[[39261, 30, 0, 806, 3, 0, 7453, 278], [0, 7453, 278, 30, 0, 153, 3, 0, 719, 42, 161, 98, 5421, 5, 99763, 21, 68, 682, 873], [39261, 435, 17, 0, 161, 3, 0, 7453, 278, 6, 360, 5, 1289, 5, 17, 22995, 3, 0, 7453, 278]], [[29, 7453, 278, 30, 943, 6, 64, 1189, 5, 2694], [53, 346, 37, 113, 15556, 33, 596, 4083, 2280, 10, 2493, 117, 14598, 6, 109, 494, 311], [85802], [85802, 1301], [5865, 3, 0, 278, 341, 943, 5, 581], [6, 85802, 28015, 3420], [], [303709, 0, 7453, 278, 6, 360, 5, 1289], [4336, 16445, 50, 196], [], [], [], [158, 2493, 117, 14598, 86, 11530, 24169, 7, 205, 5, 30, 0, 465, 389, 10, 7453, 2614], [0, 1554, 3, 7556, 42, 30, 6624, 21, 0, 2493, 117, 14598, 30, 580, 26579, 7556], [37, 30, 113, 20, 30, 3462, 18866, 6, 162, 12428, 5, 30, 1857, 161, 7, 720, 7, 162, 7159, 5, 6480, 30, 5005, 281809]], [[34796, 5, 91, 35347, 33, 7, 232, 1554, 3, 7556], [37, 30, 580, 23232, 7556, 113, 20, 2715, 771, 5421], [127, 83, 0, 215, 5421, 3771, 378, 0, 2614, 30, 181, 562, 5, 1605], [37, 72606, 2711, 21763, 7, 5977, 5300, 1979, 5, 17, 20, 35347], [86, 3981, 74, 7, 173, 5340, 6, 7, 30065, 3823, 311], []]]}, {"title": "Types of immunity in vertebrates", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Innate immune response", "text": "The innate immune system is usually means all of the cells and systems that does not have to be exposed to a particular pathogen before they can work.\n\nInnate immunity starts with the skin, which is an excellent barrier to infection.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 26579, 7453, 278, 30, 1140, 1702, 64, 3, 0, 2114, 5, 278, 12, 14219, 36, 33, 4, 30, 10920, 4, 7, 1671, 30065, 106, 39, 86, 161]], [[26579, 7556, 465, 17, 0, 3825, 42, 30, 7, 4345, 5826, 4, 5421]]]}, {"title": "Adaptive immune response", "text": "The adaptive immune system includes cells and systems that do require previous exposure to a pathogen.

This is because in the original Roman calendar, winter did not have months. Although March was originally the first month, January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new consuls (Roman leaders). The month has 31 days.\n\nJanuary is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere and a summer month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of July in the other. Perihelion, the point in its orbit where the Earth is closest to the Sun, also occurs in this month, between January 2 and January 5. January begins on the same day of the week as October in common years and on the same day of the week as April and July in leap years. January ends on the same day of the week as February and October in common years and on the same day of the week as July in leap years. January is the only month of the year that always has a \"twin\" - a month that both begins and ends on the same day of the week as it does. In a common year, this is October, and in a leap year, July.\n\nEvery year, January both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as May of the previous year, as each other's first and last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\n\nIn common years immediately before other common years, January starts on the same day of the week as April and July of the following year, and in leap years and years immediately before that, September and December of the following year. In common years immediately before other common years, January finishes on the same day of the week as July of the following year, and in leap years and years immediately before that, April and December of the following year.\n\nJanuary's flower is the carnation with its birthstone being the garnet. The meaning of the garnet is constancy.\n\nThe first day of January is called New Year's Day. It is said that it became this date when Roman consuls took office on this day in 153 BC. Different calendars across Europe made this the start of the New Year at different times, as some observed it on March 25.\n\nReaching over from December, the Christmas season in Christianity also extends into this month. Eastern churches celebrate Christmas on January 6 or January 7, and Epiphany on January 18 or January 19 - In Western Christianity this occurs on January 6, with Christmas occurring on December 25.\n\nJanuary 1 is celebrated the Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God, that is a feast day of precept of the Blessed Virgin Mary.<ref></ref>", "paragraphs": [[[450, 30, 311, 10, 30219, 0, 1956, 1533, 3, 1888, 5, 4513]], [[450, 5, 617, 30, 339, 13, 0, 5657, 49, 64, 0, 68, 229], [37, 30, 113, 6, 0, 929, 1956, 5657, 1601, 88, 36, 33, 229], [376, 304, 30, 1447, 0, 229, 450, 399, 0, 50, 229, 113, 12, 30, 61, 69, 3008, 0, 50, 12679, 1956, 329], [0, 229, 33, 122]], [[450, 30, 7, 1601, 229, 6, 0, 529, 8687, 5, 7, 740, 229, 6, 0, 482, 8687], [6, 236, 8687, 20, 30, 0, 8417, 3744, 3, 375, 6, 0, 68], [76868, 0, 389, 6, 47, 6960, 111, 0, 1828, 30, 383, 4, 0, 1662, 52, 3771, 6, 37, 229, 118, 450, 5, 450], [450, 1092, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 478, 6, 861, 62, 5, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 396, 5, 375, 6, 9028, 62], [450, 156, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 617, 5, 478, 6, 861, 62, 5, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 375, 6, 9028, 62], [450, 30, 0, 91, 229, 3, 0, 62, 12, 690, 33, 7, 4541, 7, 229, 12, 150, 1092, 5, 156, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 20, 14219], [6, 7, 861, 62, 37, 30, 478, 5, 6, 7, 9028, 62, 375]], [[359, 62, 450, 150, 465, 5, 1624, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 107, 3, 0, 771, 62, 7, 236, 68, 5, 76, 122, 30, 2796, 147, 122, 2725]], [[6, 861, 62, 1040, 106, 68, 861, 62, 450, 465, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 396, 5, 375, 3, 0, 1816, 62, 5, 6, 9028, 62, 5, 62, 1040, 106, 12, 441, 5, 470, 3, 0, 1816, 62], [6, 861, 62, 1040, 106, 68, 861, 62, 450, 1624, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 375, 3, 0, 1816, 62, 5, 6, 9028, 62, 5, 62, 1040, 106, 12, 396, 5, 470, 3, 0, 1816, 62]], [[450, 6504, 30, 0, 54238, 17, 47, 147564, 30, 0, 41837], [0, 1702, 3, 0, 41837, 30, 73938]], [[0, 122, 3, 450, 30, 580, 50, 62, 122], [20, 30, 203, 12, 20, 399, 37, 1257, 61, 1956, 12679, 190, 283, 13, 37, 122, 6, 1832], [494, 5657, 531, 525, 159, 37, 0, 465, 3, 0, 50, 62, 22, 494, 79, 7, 77, 8587, 20, 13, 304]], [[2403, 74, 25, 470, 0, 2179, 195, 6, 7282, 52, 3459, 75, 37, 229], [828, 512, 4686, 2179, 13, 450, 46, 450, 5, 29929, 13, 450, 46, 450, 6, 556, 7282, 37, 3771, 13, 450, 17, 2179, 3771, 13, 470]], [[450, 30, 4686, 0, 58540, 3, 1962, 0, 808, 3, 1533, 12, 30, 7, 10058, 122, 3, 61878, 3, 0, 10141, 5176]]]}, {"title": "Events", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Fixed Events", "text": "* January 1 -

In the Southern Hemisphere, it is a winter month, with the coldest-recorded temperature having been measured in Antarctica in this month.\n\nJuly begins on the same day of the week as April every year and on the same day of the week as January in leap years.

In common years immediately after other common years, July both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\n\nIn years immediately before common years, July starts on the same day of the week as September and December of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, June of the following year.

Its birthstone is the ruby. The meaning for the birthstone ruby is contented mind. Astrological signs for July are Cancer (June 21 - July 21) and Leo (July 22 - August 21).\n\nIn the old Roman calendar, July was called ''Quintilis'', meaning ''Fifth Month'' because, in the old calendar, the year began in March.

One of those records said there were many small countries (in Japan) which had wars between them and later a country, ruled by a queen, became the strongest, unified others, and brought peace.\n\nThe Japanese began to write their own history after the 5th and 6th centuries, when people from Korea and China taught Japan about the Chinese writing system. Japan's neighbours also taught them Buddhism.<ref name=\"'Japan history'\"></ref> The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways. For example, Japanese Buddhists used ideas such as Zen more than other Buddhists.<ref name=\"'Japan history'\" />\n\nIn the ancient and Middle Ages, China gave Japan many new cultural ideas, but their friendship became weaker later.

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit Japan. Later, the Spanish, English and Dutch came to Japan to trade. Also, they brought Christianity. Japan's leaders welcomed them at first, but because Europeans had conquered many places in the world, the Japanese were scared they would conquer Japan too. So the Japanese did not let the Europeans come into Japan anymore, except in a small area in Nagasaki city. Many Christians were killed. Only the Chinese, Korean and Dutch people were allowed to visit Japan, in the end, and they were under careful control of the Japanese government. Japan was opened for visitors again in 1854 by Commodore Matthew Perry, when the Americans wanted to use Japanese ports for American whale boats. Perry brought steamships with guns, which scared the Japanese into making an agreement with him.<ref></ref>\n\nThis new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture. The Meiji Restoration of 1868 stopped some old ways and added many new ones. The Empire of Japan was created, and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it. It invaded and annexed Ryukyu Kingdom, Taiwan, and Korea. It had wars with China and Russia: the First Sino-Japanese War, the Boxer Rebellion, the Russo-Japanese War, and the Second Sino-Japanese War, which grew to become a part of World War II when Japan became allies with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.\n\nIn 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, a water base of the United States, and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes. This started the United States' involvement in World War II. American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific. Once airbases were established within range of the Japanese mainland, America began to win, and started dropping bombs on Japanese cities. America was able to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought Japan close to defeat. To make Japan surrender, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing 150,000 Japanese citizens. Soon after this the Soviet Union began to fight against Japan, and the Japanese army in Manchuria lost. Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries, accepting the Potsdam Proclamation. The United States occupied Japan and forced it to write a new constitution, in which it promised to never go to war again.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 199, 384, 13, 361, 30, 25, 327, 2881], [48, 3, 12, 384, 203, 63, 30, 109, 357, 123, 6, 361, 42, 33, 136, 118, 101, 5, 288, 7, 123, 1067, 21, 7, 2060, 399, 0, 562, 20644, 68, 5, 938, 349]], [[0, 623, 1092, 4, 2432, 44, 261, 299, 49, 0, 5, 589, 61, 69, 25, 574, 5, 132, 5293, 361, 59, 0, 327, 2432, 278], [361, 14146, 52, 5293, 101], [], [], [0, 623, 511, 11116, 6, 109, 179], [10, 880, 623, 5809, 234, 1159, 125, 7, 15778, 181, 73, 68, 299]], [[6, 0, 2359, 5, 699, 3875, 132, 455, 361, 109, 50, 1704, 1159, 34, 44, 4581, 399, 2690, 288], [6, 0, 288, 589, 13739, 25, 132, 841, 4, 13069, 361, 1495, 34, 39, 86], [], [0, 19252, 5, 43005, 3, 6101, 361, 30, 793, 4, 4848, 5, 2370, 6, 6101, 525]], [[361, 33, 77, 1871, 17, 0, 291, 6, 0, 589], [0, 3578, 30, 0, 291, 4, 528, 361], [168, 0, 1141, 711, 5, 1692, 326, 4, 361, 4, 312], [52, 39, 938, 7282], [361, 329, 3143, 101, 22, 34, 113, 291, 33, 16461, 109, 241, 6, 0, 85, 0, 623, 30, 8190, 39, 54, 16461, 361, 317], [100, 0, 623, 88, 36, 886, 0, 291, 326, 75, 361, 5717, 2077, 6, 7, 357, 237, 6, 20937, 115], [109, 1377, 30, 1916], [91, 0, 327, 1091, 5, 1692, 69, 30, 949, 4, 528, 361, 6, 0, 156, 5, 39, 30, 124, 5604, 424, 3, 0, 623, 78], [361, 30, 310, 10, 7766, 378, 6, 21, 15404, 4770, 4481, 61, 0, 140, 303, 4, 234, 623, 1414, 10, 140, 9287, 2377], [4481, 938, 62332, 17, 2019, 42, 8190, 0, 623, 75, 159, 7, 547, 17]], [[37, 50, 1871, 17, 291, 5, 140, 511, 0, 623, 1295], [0, 28671, 5258, 3, 837, 77, 167, 179, 5, 1679, 109, 50, 48], [0, 2552, 3, 361, 30, 1210, 5, 20, 399, 7, 191, 1528, 513, 5, 841, 4, 13069, 0, 123, 182, 4, 20], [20, 13069, 5, 88412, 59220, 1859, 694, 5, 574], [20, 33, 136, 17, 132, 5, 412, 0, 58, 7854, 623, 136, 0, 8092, 5481, 0, 19183, 623, 136, 5, 0, 126, 7854, 623, 136, 42, 2274, 4, 399, 7, 153, 3, 85, 136, 819, 61, 361, 399, 3658, 17, 3929, 509, 5, 14044, 931]], [[6, 361, 436, 5726, 4593, 6, 5112, 7, 430, 815, 3, 0, 104, 112, 5, 4526, 46, 1441, 109, 1370, 5, 7350], [37, 465, 0, 104, 112, 2868, 6, 85, 136, 819], [140, 5, 623, 352, 838, 236, 68, 6, 0, 1244], [442, 82189, 30, 2617, 425, 1006, 3, 0, 623, 2545, 453, 1092, 4, 320, 5, 465, 1560, 1211, 13, 623, 115], [453, 30, 667, 4, 1211, 181, 3, 0, 481, 115, 5, 1177, 938, 361, 383, 4, 1841], [4, 159, 361, 5157, 0, 104, 112, 1560, 55, 4065, 1211, 13, 0, 115, 3, 13053, 5, 20937, 1916, 623, 3941], [720, 49, 37, 0, 1332, 354, 1092, 4, 838, 98, 361, 5, 0, 623, 330, 6, 35957, 1895], [361, 5157, 5, 455, 60, 64, 0, 241, 20, 190, 25, 68, 123, 1863, 0, 29523, 16024], [0, 104, 112, 9851, 361, 5, 352, 20, 4, 2432, 7, 50, 1199, 6, 42, 20, 3329, 4, 332, 242, 4, 136, 378]]]}, {"title": "Geography", "text": "Japan is a group of islands in the Western Pacific, off the coast of China.

Shikoku is the island to the south-west of Honshu.<ref name='CIA Factbook' />\n\nIn the middle of Japan there are mountains.<ref name='CIA Factbook' /> They cover the middle of the islands and leave a very narrow strip of flat land on most coasts. Many of the mountains are extinct volcanoes, but some are still active. The highest of these mountains is the beautiful, volcano-shaped Mt Fuji (3,776&nbsp;metres or 12,389&nbsp;feet high). Japan has many earthquakes, in fact there are about 1500 of these every year.<ref name='CIA Factbook' /> The most recent big earthquake was in 2011 - called '2011 Tohoku Earthquake'. It caused great damage to several power plants forcing Japan to shut down all its nuclear plants. There was nuclear core meltdown which caused a serious health risk to nearby villages and cities.\n\n90% of the people living in Japan live in just 10% of the land, near the coast. The other 10% of the people in Japan live away from the coast.\n\nOver 10 cities have more than a million people in them. The biggest city in Japan is Tokyo, which is the capital.", "paragraphs": [[[361, 30, 7, 129, 3, 583, 6, 0, 556, 1244, 138, 0, 954, 3, 132], [0, 133, 365, 583, 30, 56943, 19069, 55356, 5, 33163, 5, 63, 30, 59, 357, 583, 63], [361, 30, 1350, 25, 0, 967, 4944, 21, 0, 937, 3, 361, 5, 0, 322, 132, 937], [56943, 42, 1702, 2545, 6, 0, 623, 1032, 30, 0, 365, 583], [19069, 30, 0, 583, 193, 3, 56943], [33163, 30, 0, 583, 259, 3, 56943], [55356, 30, 0, 583, 4, 0, 139, 259, 3], [65952]], [[6, 0, 699, 3, 361, 63, 30], [65952], [], [39, 1333, 0, 699, 3, 0, 583, 5, 891, 7, 191, 3757, 2138, 3, 2983, 607, 13, 181, 954], [109, 3, 0, 1611, 30, 9516, 8555, 34, 77, 30, 149, 1546], [0, 152, 3, 37, 1611, 30, 0, 3366, 8555, 3030, 22226, 15003, 46, 152], [361, 33, 109, 3117, 6, 853, 63, 30, 59, 3, 37], [359, 65952], [], [0, 181, 397, 365, 3117, 30, 6, 580, 64615, 3117], [20, 1157, 353, 1441, 4, 201, 268, 1189, 352, 361, 4, 2716, 135, 64, 47, 490, 1189], [63, 30, 490, 2621, 11845, 42, 1157, 7, 1034, 360, 1118, 4, 1482, 633, 5, 115]], [[3, 0, 69, 682, 6, 361, 682, 6, 120, 3, 0, 607, 355, 0, 954], [0, 68, 3, 0, 69, 6, 361, 682, 420, 25, 0, 954]], [[74, 115, 33, 181, 73, 7, 93, 69, 6, 101], [0, 365, 115, 6, 361, 30, 1363, 42, 30, 0, 351]]]}, {"title": "Politics and government", "text": "The ruling party is the Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) and prime minister is Shinzo Abe.

The island is dry because its low elevation does not cause much rain (orographic precipitation) to fall from the northeastern trade winds.\n\nKahoolawe was used as a gunfire and bombing target by the United States military during World War II.  It was a defense training area by the United States Navy from around 1941 until May 1994.  Popular opinion in the state against this practice brought the end to this use. Navy has since been trying to cleanup unexploded ordnance (bombs and explosive shells) from the island.  Ordnance is still buried or lying on the ground. Other items have washed down gullies and still other unexploded ordnance is underwater offshore. In 1981, the entire island was included on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe island is planned to be given back to the Hawaiian people.  In 1993, the U.S. Congress passed a law that \"recognized the cultural importance of the island, required the Navy to return the island to the State, and directed the Navy to do an unexploded ordnance (UXO) cleanup and environmental restoration\" . The turnover officially occurred on November 11, 2003, but the cleanup has not yet been completed. The U.S. Navy was given $400 million and 10 years to complete the large cleanup task, but this work has gone much slower than planned.\n\nIn 1993, the Hawaii State Legislature established the Kahoolawe Island Reserve. It is made up of the whole island and waters out to  from shore. By State Law, Kahoolawe and its waters can only be used for Native Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes; fishing; environmental restoration; historic preservation; and education. Commercial uses are not allowed. The Legislature also created the Kahoolawe Island Reserve Commission (KIRC) to manage the Reserve while it is held in trust for a \"future Native Hawaiian Sovereignty entity\" . \n\nAfter the cleanup is finished, the restoration of Kahoolawe will need ways to control erosion, restore the plant life, recharge the water table, and slowly replace alien plants with native ones. Plans will include methods for damming gullies and reducing rainwater runoff. Non-natives will temporarily stabilize some areas before the permanent planting of native plants.", "paragraphs": [[[176354, 30, 0, 357, 3, 0, 502, 444, 9819, 583, 3, 5112], [20, 30, 259, 3, 24274, 5, 139, 3, 89058], [20, 30, 3208, 2586, 173, 21, 531], [0, 152, 389, 69888, 30, 1069, 937, 505], [0, 583, 30, 113, 47, 653, 7788, 14219, 36, 1157, 181, 2298, 163676, 15579, 4, 807, 25, 0, 4818, 312, 2486]], [[176354, 30, 234, 7, 7, 6990, 5, 1211, 1488, 21, 0, 104, 112, 178, 105, 85, 136, 819], [20, 30, 7, 475, 1470, 237, 21, 0, 104, 112, 1505, 25, 204, 207, 107], [814, 2166, 6, 0, 92, 98, 37, 1276, 938, 0, 156, 4, 37, 234], [1505, 33, 108, 30, 841, 4, 11224, 24053, 16194, 1211, 5, 5168, 3918, 25, 0, 583], [16194, 30, 149, 10598, 46, 4621, 13, 0, 17222], [68, 6779, 33, 9034, 135, 27930, 5, 149, 68, 24053, 16194, 30, 10473, 5800], [6, 0, 1452, 583, 30, 488, 13, 0, 121, 3476, 3, 1590, 1425]], [[0, 583, 30, 394, 4, 30, 455, 137, 4, 0, 11925, 69], [6, 0, 601, 1280, 7, 264, 12, 3807, 0, 1704, 2604, 3, 0, 583, 2324, 0, 1505, 4, 498, 0, 583, 4, 0, 92, 5, 1494, 0, 1505, 4, 88, 7, 24053, 16194, 109172, 11224, 5, 1697, 5258], [0, 4075, 2391, 3771, 13, 487, 34, 0, 11224, 33, 36, 553, 30, 1336], [0, 1505, 30, 455, 93, 5, 62, 4, 1336, 0, 426, 11224, 2170, 34, 37, 161, 33, 242, 181, 2049, 73, 394]], [[6, 0, 5112, 92, 2922, 2617, 0, 176354, 583, 1618], [20, 30, 159, 60, 3, 0, 1115, 583, 5, 430, 66, 4, 25, 4123], [21, 92, 264, 176354, 5, 47, 430, 86, 91, 30, 234, 10, 1683, 11925, 1704, 4289, 5, 22668, 2800, 2120, 1697, 5258, 1590, 7561, 5, 631], [1196, 234, 30, 36, 949], [0, 2922, 52, 1210, 0, 176354, 583, 1618, 627, 4, 4210, 0, 1618, 110, 20, 30, 802, 6, 1853, 10, 7, 581, 1683, 11925, 4519, 7526]], [[49, 0, 11224, 30, 1624, 0, 5258, 3, 176354, 43, 408, 179, 4, 424, 10875, 3614, 0, 1189, 214, 34111, 0, 430, 1801, 5, 3892, 2451, 8334, 1189, 17, 1683, 48], [559, 43, 488, 3241, 10, 4685, 27930, 5, 1680, 29468, 8506], [1337, 1683, 43, 5053, 9202, 77, 237, 106, 0, 2273, 1189, 3, 1683, 1189]]]}, {"title": "Other websites", "text": "*Kahoolawe Island Reserve Commission", "paragraphs": [[[], [176354, 583, 1618, 627]]]}]}

{"title": "Law", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Law''' is a set of rules decided by a particular state meant for the purpose of keeping the peace and security of society. \n\nCourts or police may enforce this system of rules and punish people who break the laws, such as by paying a fine, or other penalty including jail. In ancient societies, laws were written by leaders, to set out rules on how people can live, work and do business with each other. But many times in history when laws have been on a false basis to benefit few at the expense of society, they have resulted in conflict. To prevent this, in most countries today, laws are written and voted on by groups of politicians in a legislature, such as a parliament or congress, elected (chosen) by the governed peoples. Countries today have a constitution for the overall framework of society and make further laws as needed for matters of detail. Members of society generally have enough freedom within all the ''legal'' things they can choose to do. An activity is ''illegal'' if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws.\n\nA legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced. This may deal with things like police, courts, or punishments. A lawyer, jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law. In the United States, there are two kinds of attorneys - \"transactional\" attorneys who write contracts and \"litigators\" who go to court. In the United Kingdom, these professionals are called solicitors and barristers respectively.\n\nThe ''Rule of Law'' is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on. It limits the powers a government has, as agreed in a country's constitution. The ''Rule of Law'' prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people. When leaders enforce the legal code honestly, even on themselves and their friends, this is an example of the rule of law being followed. \"The rule of law\", wrote the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in 350 BC, \"is better than the rule of any individual.\"\n\nCulture is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws, and people also tend to trust the ideas based on family and social habits. In many countries throughout history, religion and religious books like the Vedas, Bible or the Koran have been a major source of law.", "paragraphs": [[[264, 30, 7, 208, 3, 1067, 2099, 21, 7, 1671, 92, 1702, 10, 0, 2800, 3, 578, 0, 349, 5, 194, 3, 908]], [[2437, 46, 142, 107, 7262, 37, 278, 3, 1067, 5, 7978, 69, 38, 1129, 0, 264, 125, 7, 21, 642, 7, 1695, 46, 68, 1877, 488, 2289], [6, 2359, 908, 264, 30, 2432, 21, 329, 4, 208, 66, 1067, 13, 197, 69, 86, 682, 161, 5, 88, 258, 17, 236, 68], [34, 109, 79, 6, 299, 61, 264, 33, 30, 13, 7, 3523, 1521, 4, 2161, 306, 22, 0, 5740, 3, 908, 39, 33, 712, 6, 1302], [4, 1449, 37, 6, 181, 123, 373, 264, 30, 2432, 5, 538, 13, 21, 129, 3, 2825, 6, 7, 2922, 125, 7, 7, 668, 46, 601, 4679, 3008, 21, 0, 9909, 69], [252, 373, 33, 7, 1199, 10, 0, 1250, 4431, 3, 908, 5, 159, 372, 264, 7, 408, 10, 1120, 3, 4602], [235, 3, 908, 1573, 33, 575, 1637, 425, 64, 0, 830, 873, 39, 86, 3008, 4, 88], [29, 1830, 30, 1438, 83, 20, 1129, 7, 264, 46, 14219, 36, 1816, 0, 264]], [[7, 830, 2280, 30, 7, 2432, 2280, 3, 264, 12, 30, 7262], [37, 107, 435, 17, 873, 117, 142, 202, 46, 4433], [7, 1387, 25169, 46, 1223, 30, 7, 1162, 38, 806, 5, 4117, 0, 1067, 3, 264], [6, 0, 104, 112, 63, 30, 55, 921, 3, 1223, 57452, 1223, 38, 2432, 953, 5, 58870, 38, 242, 4, 202], [6, 0, 104, 1859, 37, 1162, 30, 580, 15359, 5, 24993, 2997]], [[0, 1067, 3, 264, 30, 0, 264, 42, 203, 12, 78, 86, 91, 5754, 234, 47, 268, 6, 7, 179, 0, 78, 5, 0, 69, 2137, 13], [20, 2514, 0, 268, 7, 78, 33, 7, 2137, 6, 7, 123, 1199], [0, 1067, 3, 264, 1449, 8710, 5, 1508, 0, 248, 3, 0, 69], [61, 329, 7262, 0, 830, 2280, 13408, 151, 13, 1000, 5, 44, 1409, 37, 30, 7, 880, 3, 0, 1067, 3, 264, 30, 1816], [], [0, 1067, 3, 264, 2432, 0, 2359, 1622, 11296, 21094, 6, 1832, 30, 143, 73, 0, 1067, 3, 130, 1426], []], [[1295, 30, 1140, 7, 224, 1173, 3, 0, 3847, 561, 109, 264, 5, 69, 52, 3989, 4, 1853, 0, 1159, 815, 13, 213, 5, 659, 9549], [6, 109, 123, 983, 299, 2830, 5, 1213, 539, 117, 0, 51256, 5489, 46, 0, 18174, 33, 30, 7, 224, 1173, 3, 264]]]}, {"title": "Types of law", "text": "* Contract law sets rules on agreements to buy and sell items and services.\n*Medical law sets rules and guidelines for medical professionals, it also states a patient's own medical rights.\n**Physician-Patient Privilege protects the patient's private conversations with a medical physician (doctor), this also extends to their personal information (like their contact details) shared with medical personnel.\n* Property law states the rights and obligations that a person has when they buy, sell, or rent homes and land (called real property or realty), and objects (called personal property).\n** Intellectual property  (IP) law involves the rights people have over things they create, such as art, music, and literature.

Zamenhof thought that one common language would join these groups and stop fights between them.\n\nHis first language was said to be Polish. His parents spoke Russian and Yiddish at home. His father was a German teacher, so Zamenhof learned that language from an early age and spoke the language fluently. Later he learned French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew and English. He also had an interest in Italian, Spanish and Lithuanian.\n\nZamenhof decided that the international language must have a simple grammar and be easier to learn than Volap\u00fck, an earlier international language. He attempted to create the international language with a grammar that was rich, and complex. The basics of Esperanto were published in 1887.\n\nHis grandson, Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof, has lived in France since the 1960s.\n\nHe was 14 times nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize between 1907 and 1917.<ref></ref>", "paragraphs": [[[132487, 30, 3045, 6, 6, 0, 328, 3, 35116, 1690], [22, 0, 79, 1690, 30, 7, 153, 3, 0, 467, 2552], [114270, 3540, 87, 224, 129, 8095, 240662, 5, 20787, 2199, 12471], [132487, 269, 12, 48, 861, 1032, 54, 1429, 37, 129, 5, 837, 838, 118, 101]], [[26, 1032, 30, 203, 4, 30, 2613], [26, 3792, 2199, 467, 5, 20787, 22, 163], [26, 629, 30, 7, 514, 2513, 100, 132487, 2368, 12, 1032, 25, 7, 199, 464, 5, 2199, 0, 1032, 42981], [168, 18, 2368, 348, 1909, 1622, 7585, 5, 711], [18, 52, 33, 7, 560, 6, 1031, 1141, 5, 10791]], [[132487, 2099, 12, 0, 146, 1032, 390, 33, 7, 2147, 9336, 5, 30, 1673, 4, 2368, 73, 187065, 7, 199, 146, 1032], [18, 1266, 4, 1210, 0, 146, 1032, 17, 7, 9336, 12, 30, 1727, 5, 1688], [0, 2007, 3, 36271, 30, 6231, 6]], [[26, 7701, 1833, 16268, 86308, 132487, 33, 682, 6, 387, 108, 0]], [[18, 30, 79, 14943, 10, 0, 4484, 349, 1936, 118, 5]]]}, {"title": "References", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Other websites", "text": "* VisitBia\u0142ystok.com", "paragraphs": [[[], []]]}]}

{"title": "Leap year", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "A '''leap year''' is a year in which an extra day is added to the Gregorian calendar, which is used by most of the world. While an ordinary year has 365 days, a leap year has 366 days. The extra day, February 29, is added to the month of February. In an ordinary year, February has 28 days, but in a leap year, it has 29 days. The extra day, called a leap day, is the same day of the week as the first day of the month, February 1. Also, in a leap year, the months of January, April, and July all start on the same day of the week.\n\nA leap year comes once every four years. Because of this, a leap year can always be evenly divided by four. For example, 2016 was a leap year. But a year is a common year if it can be evenly divided by 100 but not by 400. This is why 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 are common years.\n\nWe have leap years because instead of 365 days, the Earth really takes a few minutes less than 365-1/4 days (365.24219) to go completely around the Sun. Without leap years, the seasons would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years.

They contain printed materials, films, sound and video recordings, maps, photographs, computer software, online databases, and other media.\n\nA library is not a bookstore (a store that sells books).", "paragraphs": [[[7, 2229, 30, 7, 241, 111, 109, 539, 30, 578], [96, 2229, 30, 198, 5, 886, 69, 190, 0, 539, 4, 234, 6, 44, 163], [96, 2229, 886, 69, 9740, 539, 10, 201, 147], [77, 6288, 4, 3374, 10, 880, 128, 512, 164, 5, 221], [52, 7, 899, 53781, 22, 163, 86, 33, 109, 539, 5, 30, 7, 2229], [0, 69, 38, 161, 6, 2229, 30, 17159], [29920, 30, 69, 38, 190, 757, 3, 0, 2229]], [[68, 2229, 578, 1613, 46, 2348, 539], [63, 30, 7, 306, 4786, 2229, 42, 33, 7, 4522, 3, 359, 539, 42, 33, 30, 2432, 6, 12, 123], [77, 2229, 52, 33, 68, 873, 12, 69, 107, 117, 125, 7, 1230, 403, 13, 3537, 46, 951, 111, 69, 86, 234, 0, 925], [6, 164, 39, 901, 1516, 4, 2368, 0, 14078, 5, 68, 4602], [17, 0, 1635, 3, 10624, 2229, 33, 399, 3720, 4935, 10, 2368], [8479, 30, 191, 481, 10, 0, 1368, 5, 380, 3, 7, 908], [8479, 30, 1720, 3, 539, 5, 68, 33380, 1304], [69, 326, 4, 2229, 10, 1465, 806, 46, 2978], [8479, 3540, 7, 2165, 3, 1304], [39, 3540, 4610, 1304, 319, 1507, 5, 974, 2683, 3464, 7852, 951, 1516, 1292, 6351, 5, 68, 3185]], [[7, 2229, 30, 36, 7, 15462, 7, 1612, 12, 1243, 539]]]}, {"title": "Importance of a Library", "text": "The prime purpose of a library is to provide access to knowledge and information.

They also use library resources to gain information about personal interests. Sometimes, they obtain recreational materials such as films and novels. Students use libraries to enhance their classroom experiences.\n\nLibraries help the students to develop good reading and study habits. Public officials use libraries for research and public issues. The libraries provide information and services that are essential for learning and progress.\n\nThis habit of reading can be developed only if we get into the habit of going to a library regularly, and spending a lot of time there. That is the place that provides just the right atmosphere necessary for studies, and assimilating and retaining all the knowledge taken it. The environment in a library is ideal for the intellectual growth of individuals.\n\nThis is the place where one can get unlimited stocks of books on any and every subject that may be of interest or need for an individual.

Then the Romans rebuilt the city, and London became an important trading hub. \n\nAfter the decline of the Roman Empire, few people remained in London. This was partly because of the Anglo-Saxon people of Sub-Roman Britain being primarily agricultural. Once the Romans had gone, trade with Continental Europe dwindled. In the 9th century, more people started living in London again. It became the largest city in England. However, it did not become the capital city of England until the 12th century.\n\nAfter the railways were built, London grew very big.

It was named after the war god (Mars) and the Romans thought that it was a lucky time to begin a war. Before Julius Caesar's calendar reform, March was the first month of the year in the Roman calendar, as the winter was considered to be a monthless period.\n\nMarch is one of seven months to have 31 days. March begins on the same day of the week as February in common years and November every year, as each other's first days are exactly 4 weeks (28 days) and 35 weeks (245 days) apart respectively. March ends on the same day of the week as June every year, as each other's last days are exactly 13 weeks (91 days) apart.\n\nIn common years, March starts on the same day of the week as June of the previous year, and in leap years, September and December of the previous year. In common years, March finishes on the same day of the week as September of the previous year, and in leap years, April and December of the previous year.\n\nIn years immediately before common years, March starts on the same day of the week as August of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, May of the following year. In years immediately before common years, March finishes on the same day of the week as August and November of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, May of the following year.\n\nIn leap years, the day before March 1 is February 29. This determines the position of each day of the year from there on. As an example, March 1 is usually the 60th day of the year, but in a leap year is the 61st day.\n\nIn terms of seasons, March is one of two months to have an equinox (the other is September, its seasonal equivalent in both  hemispheres), with daylight and darkness of roughly the same number of hours, halfway between the December and June solstices. In the Northern Hemisphere, spring starts in this month, while it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. The official start of either season is March 1, though the equinox can fall on March 20 or 21, occasionally on March 19. The northern spring equinox marks the start of the Iranian New Year and Baha'i New Year. It is from the March 21 date that Easter's date is calculated, on the Sunday after the first full moon in spring, meaning it can fall between March 22 and April 25 in Western Christianity.", "paragraphs": [[[6, 2359, 2618, 304, 30, 580, 99086], [20, 30, 311, 49, 0, 136, 1533, 6230, 5, 0, 1956, 269, 12, 20, 30, 7, 5065, 79, 4, 1092, 7, 136], [106, 10720, 13469, 5657, 1296, 304, 30, 0, 229, 3, 0, 62, 6, 0, 1956, 5657, 7, 0, 1601, 30, 1568, 4, 30, 7, 566]], [[304, 30, 48, 3, 438, 229, 4, 33, 122], [304, 1092, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 617, 6, 861, 62, 5, 487, 359, 62, 7, 236, 68, 122, 30, 2796, 147, 122, 5, 147, 122, 2725, 2997], [304, 156, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 344, 359, 62, 7, 236, 68, 76, 122, 30, 2796, 147, 122, 2725]], [[6, 861, 62, 304, 465, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 344, 3, 0, 771, 62, 5, 6, 9028, 62, 441, 5, 470, 3, 0, 771, 62], [6, 861, 62, 304, 1624, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 441, 3, 0, 771, 62, 5, 6, 9028, 62, 396, 5, 470, 3, 0, 771, 62]], [[6, 62, 1040, 106, 861, 62, 304, 465, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 510, 3, 0, 1816, 62, 5, 6, 62, 1040, 106, 9028, 62, 107, 3, 0, 1816, 62], [6, 62, 1040, 106, 861, 62, 304, 1624, 13, 0, 215, 122, 3, 0, 147, 7, 510, 5, 487, 3, 0, 1816, 62, 5, 6, 62, 1040, 106, 9028, 62, 107, 3, 0, 1816, 62]], [[6, 9028, 62, 0, 122, 106, 304, 30, 617], [37, 2387, 0, 704, 3, 236, 122, 3, 0, 62, 25, 63, 13], [19, 7, 880, 304, 30, 1140, 0, 122, 3, 0, 62, 34, 6, 7, 9028, 62, 30, 0, 122]], [[6, 570, 3, 195, 304, 30, 48, 3, 55, 229, 4, 33, 7, 36118, 0, 68, 30, 441, 47, 8417, 3744, 6, 150, 8687, 17, 12220, 5, 8150, 3, 3208, 0, 215, 30355, 3, 1152, 8352, 118, 0, 470, 5, 344, 33631], [6, 0, 529, 8687, 1509, 465, 6, 37, 229, 110, 20, 30, 6588, 6, 0, 482, 8687], [0, 239, 465, 3, 900, 195, 30, 304, 413, 0, 36118, 86, 807, 13, 304, 46, 4476, 13, 304], [0, 529, 1509, 36118, 799, 0, 465, 3, 0, 1861, 50, 62, 5, 50, 62], [20, 30, 25, 0, 304, 1257, 12, 8119, 1257, 30, 14113, 13, 0, 240, 49, 0, 549, 3377, 6, 1509, 1702, 20, 86, 807, 118, 304, 5, 396, 6, 556, 7282]]]}, {"title": "Events in March", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Fixed events", "text": "* March 1 -

It is one of seven months to have 31 days. In the older Roman calendar, May was the third month of the year. It is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of November in the other. May is likely to have been named after the Roman goddess Maia, though there is a theory that May might have its name from the Latin \"Maiores\", meaning \"Seniors\". The same theory suggests that June would then be named from \"Iuniores\", meaning \"Juniors\".\n\nNo other month in any year, common or leap year, begins nor ends on the same day of the week as May.\n\nIn common years, May starts on the same day of the week as August of the previous year, and in leap years, March and November of the previous year. In common years, May finishes on the same day of the week as August and November of the previous year, and in leap years, March and June of the previous year. In leap years and years immediately after that, May starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year. \n\nEvery year, May both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as January of the following year, as each other's first and last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.

This means high and low notes. Tunes are made of notes that go up or down or stay on the same pitch.\n* Music often has ''rhythm''. Rhythm is the way the musical sounds and silences are put together in a sequence. Every tune has a rhythm that can be tapped. Music usually has a regular beat.\n* Music often has ''dynamics''. This means whether it is quiet or loud or somewhere in between.\n* Music often has ''timbre''. This is a French word (pronounced the French way: \"TAM-br\"). The \"timbre\" of a sound is the way that a sound is interesting. The sort of sound might be harsh, gentle, dry, warm, or something else.

Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence. In similar profusions of detail, art, music, architecture, and literature inspired each other in the Baroque cultural movement as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns.

Other composers, such as Franz Schubert wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called Lied (the German word for \"song\").

Many 20th century composers wanted to compose music that sounded different from the Classical and Romantic music. Modern composers searched for new ideas, such as using new instruments, different forms, different sounds, or different harmonies.\n\nThe composer Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) wrote pieces which were atonal (meaning that they did not sound as if they were in any clear musical key). Later, Schoenberg invented a new system for writing music called twelve-tone system. Music written with the twelve-tone system sounds strange to some, but is mathematical in nature, often making sense only after careful study. Pure twelve-tone music was popular among academics in the fifties and sixties, but some composers such as Benjamin Britten use it today, when it is necessary to get a certain feel.\n\nOne of the most important 20th-century composers, Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971), wrote music with very complicated (difficult) chords (groups of notes that are played together) and rhythms. Some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote Minimalist pieces which use very simple ideas. In the 1950s and 1960s, composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen experimented with electronic music, using electronic circuits, amplifiers and loudspeakers. In the 1970s, composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from rock and roll music, such as the electric guitar.

There were many black musicians living there who played a style of music called blues music. Blues music was influenced by African music (because the black people in the United States had come to the United States as slaves. They were taken from Africa by force). Blues music was a music that was played by singing, using the harmonica, or the acoustic guitar. Many blues songs had sad lyrics about sad emotions (feelings) or sad experiences, such as losing a job, a family member dying, or having to go to jail (prison).\n\nJazz music mixed together blues music with European music. Some black composers such as Scott Joplin were writing music called ragtime, which had a very different rhythm from standard European music, but used notes that were similar to some European music. Ragtime was a big influence on early jazz, called Dixieland jazz. Jazz musicians used instruments such as the trumpet, saxophone, and clarinet were used for the tunes (melodies), drums for percussion and plucked double bass, piano, banjo and guitar for the background rhythm (rhythmic section). Jazz is usually improvised: the players make up (invent) the music as they play. Even though jazz musicians are making up the music, jazz music still has rules; the musicians play a series of chords (groups of notes) in order.\n\nJazz music has a swinging rhythm. The word \"swing\" is hard to explain. For a rhythm to be a \"swinging rhythm\" it has to feel natural and relaxed. Swing rhythm is not even like a march. There is a long-short feel instead of a same-same feel. A \"swinging rhythm\" also gets the people who are listening excited, because they like the sound of it. Some people say that a \"swinging rhythm\" happens when all the jazz musicians start to feel the same pulse and energy from the song. If a jazz band plays very well together, people will say \"that is a swinging jazz band\" or \"that band really swings well.\"\n\nJazz influenced other types of music like the Western art music from the 1920s and 1930s. Art music composers such as George Gershwin wrote music that was influenced by jazz. Jazz music influenced pop music songs. In the 1930s and 1940s, many pop music songs began using chords or melodies from jazz songs. One of the best known jazz musicians was Louis Armstrong (1900-1971).", "paragraphs": [[[3281, 30, 7, 1554, 3, 403, 12, 30, 24073, 204, 6, 50, 3580, 6, 0, 139, 3, 0, 2396], [63, 30, 109, 521, 5590, 682, 63, 38, 282, 7, 1135, 3, 403, 580, 1185, 403], [4312, 403, 30, 1729, 21, 685, 403, 113, 0, 521, 69, 6, 0, 104, 112, 33, 326, 4, 0, 104, 112, 7, 7517], [39, 30, 190, 25, 637, 21, 352], [4312, 403, 30, 7, 403, 12, 30, 282, 21, 112622, 234, 0, 28744, 46, 0, 10257, 3822], [109, 1185, 813, 33, 5279, 16347, 59, 5279, 8492, 2518, 46, 5279, 1221, 125, 7, 1895, 7, 664, 7, 213, 393, 16288, 46, 33, 4, 242, 4, 2289, 997]], [[3281, 403, 3634, 600, 1185, 403, 17, 291, 403], [77, 521, 4958, 125, 7, 1893, 31635, 30, 2432, 403, 580, 36699, 42, 33, 7, 191, 494, 7283, 25, 1224, 291, 403, 34, 234, 1812, 12, 30, 793, 4, 77, 291, 403], [36699, 30, 7, 365, 1729, 13, 199, 3281, 580, 65627, 3281], [3281, 5590, 234, 6128, 125, 7, 0, 15744, 19317, 5, 23594, 30, 234, 10, 0, 6979, 12052, 7736, 10, 15233, 5, 36331, 1278, 4682, 4809, 25912, 5, 3822, 10, 0, 2093, 7283, 17488, 1519], [3281, 30, 1140, 40671, 0, 648, 159, 60, 24073, 0, 403, 7, 39, 282], [151, 413, 3281, 5590, 30, 159, 60, 0, 403, 3281, 403, 149, 33, 1067, 0, 5590, 282, 7, 281, 3, 15607, 129, 3, 1812, 6, 460]], [[3281, 403, 33, 7, 7283], [0, 1388, 4923, 30, 605, 4, 3392], [10, 7, 7283, 4, 30, 7, 7283, 20, 33, 4, 998, 1132, 5, 10593], [4923, 7283, 30, 36, 151, 117, 7, 304], [63, 30, 7, 173, 636, 998, 773, 3, 7, 215, 215, 998], [7, 7283, 52, 169, 0, 69, 38, 30, 4927, 26638, 113, 39, 117, 0, 1507, 3, 20], [77, 69, 203, 12, 7, 7283, 1927, 61, 64, 0, 3281, 5590, 465, 4, 998, 0, 215, 12700, 5, 634, 25, 0, 813], [83, 7, 3281, 775, 282, 191, 219, 600, 69, 43, 203, 12, 30, 7, 3281, 775, 46, 12, 775, 588, 4923, 219], []], [[3281, 1729, 68, 1554, 3, 403, 117, 0, 556, 760, 403, 25, 0, 5], [760, 403, 4958, 125, 7, 649, 28673, 2432, 403, 12, 30, 1729, 21, 3281], [3281, 403, 1729, 2564, 403, 813], [6, 0, 5, 109, 2564, 403, 813, 1092, 234, 15607, 46, 12052, 25, 3281, 813], [48, 3, 0, 143, 346, 3281, 5590, 30, 1833, 5016]]]}, {"title": "Pop music", "text": "\"Pop\" music is a type of ''popular'' music that many people like to listen to.

The capital used to be Toledo until 1561.\n\nMadrid is in the middle of Spain, in the Community of Madrid. The Community is a large area that includes the city as well as small towns and villages outside the city. 7 million people live in the Community. More than 3 million live in the city itself. It is the largest city of Spain and, at 655 m (2,100&nbsp;ft) above sea level, the highest capital of any European country.  It is the third largest city in the European Union.  It has four important footballs teams, Real Madrid,      Atl\u00e9tico Madrid ,Getafe and Rayo Vallecano.\n\nMadrid was ruled by the Romans from the 2nd century. After AD 711 it was occupied by the Moors. In 1083 Spain was ruled again by Spaniards. Catholic kings ruled the country. By the mid-16th century it had become the capital of a very large empire. Spain was ruled by monarchs from the House of Habsburg, then the House of Bourbon. After the Spanish Civil War it was ruled by a dictator until the mid-1970s when it became a democracy.\n\nAs it is the capital city, Madrid is where the monarch lives and also where the government meets.\n\nMadrid is the financial centre of Spain.

The Phoenicians came in 1100 BC, followed by Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Visigoths and Moors. It was not until 1492, when the Catholic Monarchs got power, that Spain became a united country. Jews and Moors, who had lived happily there for many years, were driven away. Spain became very rich because it conquered many overseas countries, especially in Central and South America. However, Spain fought many wars and lost much of its treasure. It was very poor in 1936 when the Civil War was fought. General Franco became a harsh dictator until 1975 when Juan Carlos I was brought back to Spain and made king. There is now a democratic government.\n\nIn prehistoric times people lived in the area which is now Madrid. The Romans lived there for several centuries. The origin of today\u2019s city really starts in the 9th century when Muhammad I had a small palace built where the Palacio Real stands today. The Moors built strong forts in Madrid in 865 and put a wall round the city. These walls stood until 1476 when they were knocked down. In 1561 Felipe I moved the royal court from Toledo to Madrid. Madrid had now become the capital of a very large empire. Over the next years and decades the Plaza Mayor was built and many great buildings and monuments, many of which still stand.\n\nWhen Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile came to Madrid, Spain had become a very rich country. The 16th and 17th centuries are now known as the \u201cGolden Century\u201d. Their grandson was the famous Charles I of Spain (also known as Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor). He liked his court to be in Seville. His son, Philip II (1527\u20131598) moved the court to Madrid in 1561. \n  \nIn the late 1800s there was a revolt, known as the First Spanish Republic. Later the monarchy was restored, but then there was a Second Spanish Republic followed by the Spanish Civil War. The Second Spanish Republic started on 14 April 1931 and was celebrated in La puerta del Sol which is the center of the city. Madrid suffered a lot in this war. It was bombed by airplanes.\n\nDuring the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, especially during the 1960s, the south of Madrid became very industrialized, and many people from the rural areas moved to Madrid especially to the south east of the city.\n\nWhen General Franco had died and democracy was restored, Madrid became more prosperous.

Instead, they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed.<ref name=NOVA/> One person who owned many cows could trade with another person who had a lot of wheat. Each would trade a little of what he had with the other. This would support the people on his farm. Other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable. This gave rise to trade items such as jewelry and spices.\n \nWhen people changed from trading in things like, for example, cows and wheat to using money instead, they needed things that would last a long time. They must still have a known value, and could be carried around. The first country in the world to make metal coins was called Lydia.<ref name=BritMuseum></ref> These first appeared during the 7th century BC, in the western part of what is now Turkey.<ref name=BritMuseum/> The Lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a lion. This idea soon spread to Greece, the rest of the Mediterranean, and the rest of the world. Coins were all made to the same size and shape. In some parts of the world, different things have been used as money, like clam shells or blocks of salt.\n\nBesides being easier to carry than cows, using money had many other advantages. Money is ''easier to divide'' than many trade goods. If someone own cows, and wants to trade for only \"half a cow's worth\" of wheat, he probably does not want to cut his cow in half. But if he sells his cow for money, and buys wheat with money, he can get exactly the amount he wants.\n\nCows die, and wheat rots. But money ''lasts longer'' than most trade goods. If someone sells a cow for money, he can save that money away until he needs it. He can always leave it to his children when he dies. It can last a very long time, and he can use it at any time.\n\nNot every cow is as good as another cow. Some cows are sick and old, and others are healthy and young. Some wheat is good and other wheat is moldy or stale. So if a person trades cows for wheat, he might have a hard time arguing over how much wheat each cow is worth. However, money is ''standard''. That means one dollar is worth the same as another dollar. It is easier to add up and count money, than to add up the value of different cows or amounts of wheat.\n\nLater, after coins had been used for hundreds of years, paper money started out as a promise to pay in coin, much like an \"I.O.U.\" note. The first true paper money was used in China in the 10th century AD.<ref></ref> Paper money was also printed in Sweden between 1660 and 1664.<ref></ref> Both times, it did not work well, and had to be stopped because the banks kept running out of coins to pay on the notes. Massachusetts Bay Colony printed paper money in the 1690s.<ref></ref> This time, the use became more common.\n\nToday, most of what people think of as money is not even things you can hold.

{"title": "Multiplication", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Multiplication''' is an arithmetic operation for finding the ''product'' of two numbers.\nMultiplication is the third operation in maths after addition which is the first, subtraction which is the second and then there is multiplication.\n\nWith natural numbers, it tells you the number of tiles in a rectangle where one of the two numbers equals the number of tiles on one side and the other number equals the number of tiles on the other side.\n\nWith real numbers, it tells you the area of a rectangle where the first number equals the size of one side and the second number equals the size of the other side.\n\nFor example, three multiplied by five is the total of five threes added together, or the total of three fives. This can be written down as 3 \u00d7 5 = 15, or spoken as \"three times five equals fifteen.\" Mathematicians call the two numbers you wish to multiply \"coefficients\" together, or ''\"multiplicand\"'' and ''\"multiplicator\"'' separately. Multiplicand \u00d7 multiplicator = product.\n\nMultiplication between numbers is said to be commutative- when the order of the numbers does not influence the value of the product. This is true for the Integers (whole numbers), e.g. 4 \u00d7 6 is the same as 6 \u00d7 4, and also for the Rational numbers (fractions), and for all the other Real numbers (representable as a field in the continuous line), and also for Complex numbers (numbers representable as a field in the plane). It is not true for quaternions (numbers representable as a ring in the four-dimensional space), vectors or matrices.\n\nThe definition of multiplication as repeated\u00a0addition\u00a0provides a way to arrive at a set-theoretic interpretation of multiplication of\u00a0cardinal numbers. A more accurate representation is to think of it as scaling quantities. This animation illustrates 3 being multiplied by 2, giving 6 as a result. Notice that the blue dot in the blue segment of length 3 is placed at position 1, and the blue segment is scaled so that this dot is placed at the end of the red segment, of length 2. For multiplication by any X, the blue dot will always start at 1 and end at X. This works even for X smaller than 1, or negative.\n\nThe opposite of multiplication is division.", "paragraphs": [[[29298, 30, 7, 21613, 957, 10, 596, 0, 1459, 3, 55, 223], [29298, 30, 0, 314, 957, 6, 7460, 49, 1072, 42, 30, 0, 58076, 42, 30, 0, 232], [5, 127, 63, 30, 29298]], [[17, 1132, 223, 20, 1361, 81, 0, 30355, 3, 16826, 6, 7, 36851, 111, 48, 3, 0, 55, 223, 3024, 0, 30355, 3, 16826, 13, 48, 437, 5, 0, 68, 30355, 3024, 0, 30355, 3, 16826, 13, 0, 68, 437]], [[17, 567, 223, 20, 1361, 81, 0, 237, 3, 7, 36851, 111, 0, 30355, 3024, 0, 1275, 3, 48, 437, 5, 0, 232, 30355, 3024, 0, 1275, 3, 0, 68, 437]], [[10, 880, 87, 25172, 21, 174, 30, 0, 477, 3, 174, 87, 1679, 600, 46, 0, 477, 3, 87, 174], [37, 86, 30, 2432, 135, 7, 46, 2199, 7, 87, 79, 174, 3024, 7604], [], [29299, 580, 0, 55, 223, 81, 3467, 4, 25172, 24809, 600, 46], [5, 5244], [1459]], [[29298, 118, 223, 30, 203, 4, 30, 61, 0, 460, 3, 0, 223, 14219, 36, 1729, 0, 1158, 3, 0, 1459], [37, 30, 1446, 10, 0, 30269, 1115, 223, 30, 0, 215, 7, 5, 52, 10, 0, 10995, 223, 9330, 5, 10, 64, 0, 68, 567, 223, 165736, 7, 7, 610, 6, 0, 6860, 331, 5, 52, 10, 1688, 223, 223, 165736, 7, 7, 610, 6, 0, 1313], [20, 30, 36, 1446, 10, 95518, 223, 165736, 7, 7, 2930, 6, 0, 133, 13969, 863, 11494, 46, 9534]], [[0, 4743, 3, 29298, 7, 5148, 1072, 761, 7, 179, 4, 3704, 22, 7, 208, 102683, 6512, 3, 29298, 3, 5774, 223], [7, 181, 5697, 5862, 30, 4, 269, 3, 20, 7, 2121, 10019], [37, 7673, 14234, 30, 25172, 21, 455, 7, 7, 712], [3995, 12, 0, 1185, 9500, 6, 0, 1185, 6118, 3, 2653, 30, 241, 22, 704, 5, 0, 1185, 6118, 30, 2121, 100, 12, 37, 9500, 30, 241, 22, 0, 156, 3, 0, 639, 6118, 3, 2653], [10, 29298, 21, 130, 1585, 0, 1185, 9500, 43, 690, 465, 22, 5, 156, 22], [37, 161, 151, 10, 1585, 357, 73, 46, 2563]], [[0, 3793, 3, 29298, 30, 722]]]}, {"title": "Multiplication table", "text": "Teachers usually require their pupils to memorize the table of the first 9 numbers when teaching multiplication.", "paragraphs": [[[2562, 1140, 2324, 44, 12898, 4, 45263, 0, 1801, 3, 0, 223, 61, 5293, 29298]]]}, {"title": "Related pages", "text": "* Addition\n* Square number\n* Subtraction", "paragraphs": [[[1072, 1249, 30355], [58076]]]}]}

{"title": "Mechanistic paradigm", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "The '''mechanistic paradigm''', also known as the Newtonian paradigm, assumes that things in the environment around humans are more like machines than like life.  It was more common in the 19th century.  This is a set of loosely related beliefs that affects all sciences:\n\n*In physics it presents atoms as made of particles in preference to say the wave theory of light.  In fact, both the particle and wave view are required to explain everything light does, but are rarely presented as equals.  Many physics students graduate fully understanding the hydrogen bomb but having no clear idea of how musical instruments work.\n*In astrophysics it assumes that the universe is like clockwork and works on its own without our choice making any difference - this fits relativity but is not easy to combine with quantum mechanics.\n*In cosmology it accepts models of our universe more easily if reject the continuous creation of matter, energy or any new \"other universes\".\n*In chemistry it assumes that molecules are like building blocks, and have no unpredictable or strange and unique effects when combined.  This is the basic assumption of mechanosynthesis which some scientists think will create a molecular assembler.\n*In biology it assumes that everything about life - all of biochemistry - is predictable from chemistry and physics.\n*Believers tend to regard ecology and psychology as \"less scientific\" than physics, chemistry and biology.\n*Believers may reject ideas like psychoneuroimmunology, Gaia philosophy or Fecund universes for no scientific reason, simply because these theories assume \"higher level phenomena\" sometimes drive lower levels.\n*Greedy Reductionism may be more likely among believers in mechanistic ideas.  For instance, they may want to always see things as made of smaller, even invisible, parts that no one can see or prove is real - like in string theory.\n*For this reason, when they work in psychology, they may prefer theories like behaviorism that deny free will and try to explain human behaviour as a function of biology.\n*The philosophy of mathematics of most believers is a form of Platonism.  This assumes there is a perfect or ideal form that theories only approximate.  This lets them explain inaccuracies in mechanistic theories as being due to an imperfection in human ability to reason, instead of imperfections in math itself.\n\nBelievers in this paradigm sometimes say that those who do not believe in it are following a '''cognitive paradigm''' - but almost no one uses this term, since it is redundant - cognitive science is already accepted as the most basic idea in the philosophy of science.  But mechanists reject some of the ideas of cognitive scientists, like cognitive science of mathematics.\n\nMechanistic thinking also assumes that philosophy of perception is much less important than cognitive scientists say it is - that humans and their beliefs and equipment do not generally add a lot of bias to a scientific theory.  Thomas Kuhn said otherwise, that these things matter, and that the major assumptions of science, can shift drastically.  This he called a '''paradigm shift'''.  The shift from mechanistic to cognitive paradigm is an example of this.\nLater he used other words to describe the assumptions and beliefs, like mind-set, but the word \"paradigm\" is still used.  Some say it is much over-used.\n\nEconomics is often said to \"suffer from\" assumptions of the mechanistic paradigm.  Sometimes those who believe in neoclassical economics and also in the mechanistic paradigm say they \"seek to unify physics and economics,\" as if people and particles behaved as two examples of the same kind of thing.\n\nTechnology is often easier to make if people accept a mechanistic paradigm - but it may be harder to say why it does not work, if one believes in these ideas.  For instance, creating diagnostic trees might be easier if one works from experience, not from an idea of how a technology should or must work.\n\nA controversial idea is that mechanistic ideas are just an older idea called scholasticism, with more mathematics.  Both tried to work from what should or must be, instead of what experiment seemed to show.\n\nAnother controversial idea is that scientism, belief in science as if it were a religion or ethical tradition, comes from this paradigm.  Most scientists who are mechanistic do not say they see science as a guide to ethics, but try to keep them separate.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 80222, 20220, 52, 346, 7, 0, 59759, 20220, 5507, 12, 873, 6, 0, 1557, 204, 473, 30, 181, 117, 2358, 73, 117, 214], [20, 30, 181, 861, 6, 0, 589], [37, 30, 7, 208, 3, 11783, 11089, 4440, 12, 3194, 64, 1121]], [[], [6, 106166, 20, 943, 14367, 7, 159, 3, 12886, 6, 9457, 4, 203, 0, 2686, 2314, 3, 897], [6, 853, 150, 0, 12886, 5, 2686, 1139, 30, 2324, 4, 3392, 1174, 897, 14219, 34, 30, 4022, 943, 7, 3024], [109, 106166, 1283, 3482, 1857, 1906, 0, 9264, 1211, 34, 33, 84, 706, 1159, 3, 197, 2148, 6128, 161], [], [6, 35766, 20, 5507, 12, 0, 5187, 30, 117, 38131, 5, 161, 13, 47, 261, 296, 162, 1675, 159, 130, 2333, 37, 3130, 22651, 34, 30, 36, 1673, 4, 6582, 17, 9868, 14277], [], [6, 33770, 20, 1863, 1423, 3, 162, 5187, 181, 2407, 83, 5903, 0, 6860, 2675, 3, 4041, 634, 46, 130, 50, 68, 5187], [], [6, 6422, 20, 5507, 12, 15712, 30, 117, 1190, 1963, 5, 33, 84, 12438, 46, 5186, 5, 3006, 1261, 61, 6582], [37, 30, 0, 2007, 9303, 3, 42, 77, 4756, 269, 43, 1210, 7, 9408, 62783], [], [6, 7634, 20, 5507, 12, 1174, 59, 214, 64, 3, 26663, 30, 12670, 25, 6422, 5, 106166], [], [13752, 3989, 4, 4641, 11470, 5, 6878, 7, 333, 2440, 73, 106166, 6422, 5, 7634], [], [13752, 107, 5903, 1159, 117, 45451, 4044, 46, 126477, 5187, 10, 84, 2440, 1247, 1481, 113, 37, 2314, 5507, 152, 505, 6388, 1071, 1203, 653, 505], [], [20333, 124475, 107, 30, 181, 647, 244, 19008, 6, 80222, 1159], [10, 3233, 39, 107, 303, 4, 690, 253, 873, 7, 159, 3, 357, 151, 11064, 153, 12, 84, 48, 86, 253, 46, 2827, 30, 567, 117, 6, 3758, 2314], [], [10, 37, 1247, 61, 39, 161, 6, 6878, 39, 107, 5750, 2314, 117, 109891, 12, 5227, 415, 43, 5, 841, 4, 3392, 473, 9059, 7, 7, 3137, 3, 7634], [], [0, 4044, 3, 6510, 3, 181, 19008, 30, 7, 683, 3, 129810], [37, 5507, 63, 30, 7, 2615, 46, 5692, 683, 12, 2314, 91, 16147], [37, 886, 101, 3392, 66555, 6, 80222, 2314, 7, 30, 445, 4, 7, 77858, 6, 473, 1657, 4, 1247, 773, 3, 77858, 6, 7460, 1003]], [[13752, 6, 37, 20220, 1071, 203, 12, 12, 38, 88, 36, 733, 6, 20, 30, 1816, 7, 12414, 20220, 34, 591, 84, 48, 234, 37, 570, 108, 20, 30, 19815, 12414, 1121, 30, 411, 1863, 7, 0, 181, 2007, 1159, 6, 0, 4044, 3, 1121], [34, 5903, 77, 3, 0, 1159, 3, 12414, 4756, 117, 12414, 1121, 3, 6510]], [[80222, 269, 52, 5507, 12, 4044, 3, 7062, 30, 181, 333, 481, 73, 12414, 4756, 203, 20, 30, 12, 473, 5, 44, 4440, 5, 1404, 88, 36, 1573, 1679, 7, 530, 3, 8706, 4, 7, 2440, 2314], [1160, 24101, 203, 2751, 12, 37, 873, 4041, 5, 12, 0, 224, 9303, 3, 1121, 86, 3251, 12624], [37, 18, 580, 7, 20220, 3251], [0, 3251, 25, 80222, 4, 12414, 20220, 30, 7, 880, 3, 37], [168, 18, 234, 68, 1388, 4, 4466, 0, 9303, 5, 4440, 117, 1676, 208, 34, 0, 1388, 20220, 30, 149, 234], [77, 203, 20, 30, 181, 74, 234]], [[3674, 30, 456, 203, 4, 4745, 25, 9303, 3, 0, 80222, 20220], [1071, 12, 38, 733, 6, 29005, 3674, 5, 52, 6, 0, 80222, 20220, 203, 39, 1762, 4, 20644, 106166, 5, 3674, 7, 83, 69, 5, 12886, 13751, 7, 55, 880, 3, 0, 215, 921, 3, 873]], [[732, 30, 456, 1673, 4, 159, 83, 69, 1863, 7, 80222, 20220, 34, 20, 107, 30, 605, 4, 203, 738, 20, 14219, 36, 161, 83, 48, 733, 6, 37, 1159], [10, 3233, 1210, 15546, 2654, 107, 30, 1673, 83, 48, 161, 25, 1221, 36, 25, 7, 1159, 3, 197, 7, 732, 189, 46, 390, 161]], [[7, 2782, 1159, 30, 12, 80222, 1159, 30, 120, 7, 167, 1159, 580, 111304, 17, 181, 6510], [150, 841, 4, 161, 25, 102, 189, 46, 390, 30, 773, 3, 102, 5943, 1914, 4, 273]], [[170, 2782, 1159, 30, 12, 199823, 4440, 6, 1121, 7, 83, 20, 30, 7, 2830, 46, 8374, 2836, 326, 25, 37, 20220], [96, 4756, 38, 30, 80222, 88, 36, 203, 39, 253, 1121, 7, 7, 3372, 4, 17502, 34, 841, 4, 578, 101, 1350]]]}]}

MediaWiki is a very powerful, scalable software and a feature-rich wiki implementation, that uses PHP to process and display data stored in its MySQL database.  Pages use MediaWiki's Wikitext format, so that users without knowledge of XHTML or CSS can edit them easily.\n\nWhen a user submits an edit to a page, MediaWiki writes it to the database, but without deleting the previous versions of the page, thus allowing easy reverts in case of vandalism or spamming. MediaWiki can manage image and multimedia files, too, which are stored in the filesystem. For large wikis with lots of users, MediaWiki supports caching and can be easily coupled with Squid proxy server software.\n\nAll Wikimedia projects run on MediaWiki version  .<ref>Meta wiki's version page</ref>", "paragraphs": [[[120076, 30, 0, 311, 3, 0, 1516, 12, 307, 64, 3, 0, 74397, 716], [120076, 30, 713, 6], [20, 30, 415, 8069, 815, 1516, 42, 30, 3851, 124, 0, 32816, 216, 198, 3851, 53432], [0, 1516, 30, 3851, 124, 0, 53432], [37, 1702, 20, 30, 415, 2768, 46, 310, 1173]], [[120076, 30, 1252, 4, 30, 307, 13, 7, 426, 1170, 8069, 1988, 10, 7, 2557, 12, 169, 93, 3, 416, 532, 122], [120076, 30, 7, 191, 1528, 56873, 1516, 5, 7, 2047, 1727, 38001, 3982, 12, 234, 43579, 4, 546, 5, 2873, 64168, 1612, 6, 47, 62745, 6351], [3728, 234, 120076, 3488, 100, 12, 4832, 296, 2489, 3, 97731, 46, 36225, 86, 16841, 101, 2407]], [[61, 7, 4832, 6266, 7, 16841, 4, 7, 2184, 120076, 2432, 20, 4, 0, 6351, 34, 296, 22941, 0, 771, 1062, 3, 0, 2184, 1580, 949, 1673, 23410, 6, 305, 3, 18381, 46, 83908], [120076, 86, 4210, 1959, 5, 9876, 2854, 317, 42, 30, 1612, 6, 0, 71767], [10, 426, 88997, 17, 530, 3, 4832, 120076, 280, 13482, 5, 86, 30, 2407, 1334, 17, 24816, 12926, 8069, 1516]], [[64, 74397, 716, 307, 13, 120076, 1062], [], [28747, 38001, 1062]]]}, {"title": "Usage", "text": "Because MediaWiki is flexible, many websites that want people to contribute information use MediaWiki rather than other types of wiki software.

A flying bird or a walking person are '''moving''', because they change where they are from one place to another.  There are many kinds of science and math related to movement.\n\nFor example, thanks to the work of scientists including Galileo Galilei and Albert Einstein, we know that ''position'' and motion are relative. This means that everything's position depends on where they exist in relation to other things.  For example, a ball is 5 feet away from a box, 3 feet away from a chair, and a foot away from a table.  According to Einstein, the ball's position means how far the ball is from other things, so by telling you how far the ball was from other things, I told you its position.  An object's ''movement'' is also relative.  Its movement depends on where it is in relation to other things and where it's going to in relation to other things.\n\nThere are many things involved in movement, such as speed, velocity, acceleration, gravity, magnetic attraction and repulsion, friction, and inertia.

All of these are metaphors, although we do not usually notice this.\n\nWe use metaphors to make ''indirect'' comparisons, but without using 'like' or 'as' \u2013 because that would be a simile. A simile is a ''direct'' comparison: \"Jane is like a child\".\n\nA metaphor very often uses the verb 'to be': \"love ''is'' war\", for example, not \"love ''is like'' war\" (that is a simile).\nPoetry includes much metaphor, usually more than prose.\n\nSpam is an example that any email user knows about \u2013 this word was originally a metaphor, from 'Spam', a type of canned meat. Servers putting unwanted email into somebody's inbox was similar to waiters putting unwanted Spam into food.  This was originally suggested by a Monty Python scene. When we use a metaphor very often and we forget the old meaning, or forget that the two meanings are connected, this is a 'dead metaphor'.\n\nOriginally ''metaphor'' was a Greek word for 'transfer'. It came from ''meta'' ('beyond') and ''pherein'' ('carry'). So the word ''metaphor'' in English was a metaphor, too. Today in Greek, ''metaphor'' is a trolley (a thing that is pushed for carrying shopping or bags).\n\n*Most metaphors are concepts:  see conceptual metaphor.\n*Idioms use metaphors, or are metaphors: for example, the English phrase ''to kick the bucket'' means ''to die''.", "paragraphs": [[[15078, 30, 7, 570, 10, 7, 1265, 3, 22, 12879], [], [20, 14219, 36, 234, 7, 1388, 6, 47, 2007, 18762, 1380], [773, 20, 234, 7, 1388, 6, 7, 921, 3, 5459], [53, 307, 5, 53, 52, 203, 620, 307], [53, 107, 307, 75, 2194, 858, 83, 53, 307, 60, 7, 480, 22, 0, 2069]], [[100, 7, 15078, 234, 1388, 4, 159, 7, 1835, 6, 162, 1676], [20, 190, 7, 1388, 25, 47, 929, 4710, 5, 234, 20, 6, 170, 41, 960, 103, 17, 7, 4403, 18762, 1702, 3, 960, 41, 960, 103, 6, 7, 4019, 42580, 1702, 3, 960]], [[30789, 30, 7, 3720, 153, 3, 1032, 20, 30, 36, 555, 4, 2199, 46, 2432, 296], [43023, 1614], [], [0, 4520, 7752, 4, 0, 711, 1032], [4520, 221, 428], [15078, 858, 1519, 0, 43583, 3, 15078], [], [], [113416, 3410, 1325], [], [0, 15078, 53, 682, 21], [221, 3, 1147, 428], [], [], [], [7, 2147, 880, 30, 0, 1388, 307], [37, 33, 7, 2007, 1702, 3, 483, 1177, 46, 242, 17, 2582, 1065, 13, 7629, 2149, 332, 33, 150, 2149, 13, 0, 17222, 22, 0, 215], [32916, 4520, 10321], [], [0, 32916, 4520, 10321, 127, 455, 68, 234, 7, 7, 15224, 234, 7, 7, 19571, 59, 234, 6, 636, 6287], [64, 3, 37, 30, 15078, 376, 53, 88, 36, 1140, 3995, 37]], [[53, 234, 15078, 4, 159, 10431, 5459, 34, 296, 234, 117, 46, 7, 113, 12, 54, 30, 7, 106566], [7, 106566, 30, 7, 1494, 5459, 4917, 30, 117, 7, 964]], [[7, 15078, 191, 456, 234, 0, 15224, 4, 30, 835], [30, 136, 10, 880, 36, 835, 30, 117, 136, 12, 30, 7, 106566], [4580, 488, 181, 15078, 1140, 181, 73, 13161]], [[16391, 30, 7, 880, 12, 130, 12243, 4832, 346, 59, 37, 1388, 30, 1447, 7, 15078, 25, 16391, 7, 1554, 3, 86, 3806], [11731, 7778, 13594, 12243, 75, 4377, 63991, 30, 793, 4, 20405, 7778, 13594, 16391, 75, 565], [37, 30, 1447, 3419, 21, 7, 16941, 20019, 1500], [61, 53, 234, 7, 15078, 191, 456, 5, 53, 4458, 0, 167, 1702, 46, 4458, 12, 0, 55, 2301, 30, 6481, 37, 30, 7, 767, 15078]], [[1447, 15078, 30, 7, 1622, 1388, 10, 2397], [20, 326, 25, 28747], [1515, 5, 1619], [100, 0, 1388, 15078, 6, 711, 30, 7, 15078, 317], [373, 6, 1622, 15078, 30, 7, 22213, 7, 873, 12, 30, 1966, 10, 1619, 2855, 46, 4769]], [[], [96, 15078, 30, 2986, 253, 18689, 15078], [], [53777, 234, 15078, 46, 30, 15078, 10, 880, 0, 711, 6287, 4, 3361, 0, 16186, 1702, 4, 2357]]]}, {"title": "Simple metaphors", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Description", "text": "A simple metaphor has a single link between the subject and the metaphoric vehicle.

Some of them are still popular in the United States, which also uses units like the short ton (2,000 pounds, 907 kg) and the long ton (2,240 pounds), not to be confused with the metric tonne (1,000&nbsp;kg).", "paragraphs": [[[0, 1207, 3, 1329, 6, 0, 146, 278, 3, 1503, 30, 0, 19141, 42, 30, 2876, 21, 0, 4380, 6836], [33658, 5, 2801, 3, 37, 2007, 1207, 488, 0, 16737, 48, 7228, 3, 7, 6836, 4380, 3410, 5, 0, 16555, 48, 4119, 6836, 6835, 109, 68]], [[6, 77, 610, 46, 3250, 20, 30, 11097, 4, 234, 494, 1207, 4, 20489, 0, 3295, 46, 1649], [10, 3233, 4065, 13643, 435, 17, 0, 3293, 21933, 3, 1426, 14367, 5, 1769, 101, 6, 4065, 1329, 1207], [], [43210, 3520, 161, 17, 357, 14141, 5, 7569, 2155, 111, 21933, 30, 4246, 1769, 6, 49470, 42, 17874, 4, 46], [], [0, 21933, 3, 753, 30, 191, 426, 5, 30, 1071, 2626, 6, 1207, 3, 4708, 21933]], [[1274, 1207, 30, 149, 6, 5991, 6, 77, 123, 4443, 1207, 125, 7, 0, 6215, 46, 0, 3605, 30, 6, 2990, 234, 425, 0, 297, 2552], [77, 3, 101, 30, 149, 814, 6, 0, 104, 112, 42, 52, 234, 1207, 117, 0, 636, 8811, 3605, 6836, 5, 0, 173, 8811, 3605, 36, 4, 30, 20436, 17, 0, 8624, 16555]]]}, {"title": "Conservation of mass and relativity", "text": "Mass is an intrinsic property of the object: it does not depend on its volume, or position in space, for instance.

Astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected the spectroscopic mark of water in the Martian atmosphere, and the idea of life on Mars became popular among the public.\n\nYellow clouds on Mars have been observed since the 1870s, which were windblown sand or dust. During the 1920s, the range of Martian surface temperature was measured; it ranged from 85 to 7 <sup>o</sup>C. The planetary atmosphere was found to be arid with only traces of oxygen and water. In 1947, Gerard Kuiper showed that the thin Martian atmosphere contained extensive carbon dioxide; roughly double the quantity found in Earth's atmosphere.

Oestrus cycles may occur once or twice a year, or many times a year. Each group of mammals has its own frequency.\n\nHumans and primates, are quite different. They have a menstrual cycle. In this case, females are sexually receptive at any time, but only fertile when an ovum is released from an ovary. In this case, the endometrium (if not needed for an fertilised egg) is discarded.

Others may live in rainforests. On land the rodents (rats, mice) are hugely successful, more common in numbers than any other mammals. Large mammals on land have been hunted to extinction in some parts of the world, but the ones which remain are now better protected.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, are the primates.

We cannot call this point one, as there is already a point called one. We therefore call this point minus 1 (\u22121) (as it is one centimeter away, but in the opposite direction).\n\nA drawing of a number line is below.\n\n\n\nAll the normal operations of mathematics can be done with negative numbers:\n\nIf people add a negative number to another this is the same as taking away the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 + (\u22123) is the same as 5 \u2212 3, and equals 2.\n\nIf they take away a negative number from another this is the same as adding the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 \u2212 (\u22123) is the same as 5 + 3, and equals 8.\n\nIf they multiply two negative numbers together they get a positive number. For example, \u22125 times \u22123 is 15.\n\nIf they multiply a negative number by a positive number, or multiply a positive number by a negative number, they get a negative result. For example, 5 times \u22123 is \u221215.\n\nAs finding the square root of a negative number is impossible as negative times negative equals possitve.

November ends on the same day of the week as August every year, as each other's last days are exactly 13 weeks (91 days) apart.\n\nIn common years, November starts on the same day of the week as June of the previous year, and in leap years, September and December of the previous year. In common years, November finishes on the same day of the week as March and June of the previous year, and in leap years, September of the previous year.\n\nIn years immediately before common years, November starts on the same day of the week as August of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, May of the following year. In years immediately before common years, November finishes on the same day of the week as May of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, February and October of the following year.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, November is an Autumn (Fall) month, and the further north in the hemisphere, the more likely it is to get colder as December approaches. In the Southern Hemisphere it is a Spring month. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of May in the other.\n\nSeveral observances around the beginning of the month are believed to be related, linked to the old Celtic celebration of Samhain on November 1. These events include Halloween (October 31), Day of the Dead in Mexico (October 31 to November 2), All Saints Day (November 1) and All Souls Day (November 2).\n\nIn several mainly Christian countries, it is month in which people who died in war are commonly remembered, mainly related to the end of World War I on November 11, 1918.

Number of parts of a name'''\n\nIn some cultures, a person has a one-part name, such as \"ShiningWater.\" \n\nIn other cultures, a person has a two-part name, such as \"John Smith.\"\n\nIn some cultures, a person can have any number of name parts. In the United States, for example, some people have three: first name, middle name, and last name. Other people have only two: a first and last name.\n\nIn Chinese cultures, it is typical for a person to have three-part name, such as \"Cheah Ching San,\" where \"Cheah\" is the surname. Written in English format a comma is introduced making it \"Ching San, Cheah.\"\n\n'''2. Relations with names of parents and other relatives'''\n\nIn some cultures, people have the same \"family name\" (or surname) as their parents. For example, the father of John Smith may be Mike Smith. And Mike Smith's father may be James Smith. The \"Smith\" part is the same for all the family. \n\nIn other cultures, a person has the same name as his or her father, but the name is in a different place. For example, Shafiq Hanif's son may be Hanif Kamal. Hanif is in both the father's and son's name. \n\n'''3. Name changes'''\n\nIn some cultures, a name changes when people marry, divorce, go through some religious ceremony, etc. For example, in some Spanish-speaking countries, people use two last names: their mother's father's name and their father's name. If Elena Rodriguez Gomez and Jose Sanchez Soria marry, she may change her name to Elena Rodriguez de Sanchez, and their child could be named Pilar Sanchez Rodriguez, taking the names of both of her grandfathers. \n\n'''4. Name origins'''\n\nIn some cultures, personal names come from history. In most European countries, some first names are taken from the Bible. In some cultures, names are taken from a relative. In other cultures, a name shows what the parents hope their child will be like. A baby may be given a name Wisdom because parents hope the baby will be a wise girl or boy. \n\nSome cultures avoid giving people a name of an animal. For example, there is no name like dog, cat, snake, owl, or fish in Japanese people's first names. But in some cultures animal names may be good. \n\n'''5. Lengths, pronunciations, spelling, etc.'''\n\nIn some languages and cultures, you can tell if a word is a person's name or not by just looking at the spelling or listening to its pronunciation. There are some other linguistic patterns. For example, many Chinese names are made up of three syllables. \n\n'''6. Use of names, titles, nicknames, etc.'''\n\nIn some cultures, people use names when they call each other. In other cultures, people use their nicknames. In some other cultures, people use their titles (\"father,\" \"professor,\" etc.) when they call each other.\n\n'''7. Spelling of names, titles, nicknames, etc.'''\n\n'''8. Name awareness\n\nTaking note of names is taken a step farther by those who elect to celebrate a name (e.g., \"Celebrate Your Name Week\") whether their own name, someone else's name, or names in general, complete ownership of one's name might very well include celebrating it. \n\n'''9. Middle names\n\nWhile some people might choose to \"hide\" a middle name for any number of reasons (i.e., they consider the middle name they were given to be an \"embarrassment\"), others have taken to celebrating their middle name (e.g., \"Middle Name Pride Day\").\n\nIn the English language, names exclusively are usually pronounced in correlation with the spelling, however can be pronounced as desired, e.g. John is (jon) but can also be (ned). However, not probable, is held true in the English rules of grammar.\n\n'''Examples of names'''\n\nSarah, Lucy, Ellen, Claire, Ben.\n\nNames can be shortened e.g. Isabelle can become Izzy or Belle.", "paragraphs": [[[6, 109, 1295, 63, 30, 1067, 5, 7439, 59, 197, 4, 455, 7, 899, 7, 311]], [[77, 3, 0, 1067, 30, 6931, 21, 264, 5, 68, 30, 6931, 21, 2836, 88, 873, 6, 0, 179, 39, 33, 30, 88, 10, 7, 173, 79]], [[63, 30, 1067, 59, 494, 6395, 3, 0, 311, 5, 311, 488, 0, 1816]], [[223, 3, 153, 3, 7, 311]], [[6, 77, 1295, 7, 899, 33, 7, 48, 153, 311, 125, 7], []], [[6, 68, 1295, 7, 899, 33, 7, 55, 153, 311, 125, 7, 279, 1146], []], [[6, 77, 1295, 7, 899, 86, 33, 130, 30355, 3, 311, 153], [6, 0, 104, 112, 10, 880, 77, 69, 33, 87, 311, 699, 311, 5, 76, 311], [68, 69, 33, 91, 55, 7, 5, 76, 311]], [[6, 327, 1295, 20, 30, 3682, 10, 7, 899, 4, 33, 87, 153, 311, 125, 7, 81243, 14889, 614, 111, 81243, 30, 0, 6001], [982, 6, 711, 3488, 7, 46697, 30, 5354, 159, 20, 14889, 614, 81243], []], [[], [810, 17, 311, 3, 3792, 5, 68, 4029]], [[6, 77, 1295, 69, 33, 0, 215, 213, 311, 46, 6001, 7, 44, 3792], [10, 880, 0, 629, 3, 279, 1146, 107, 30, 1589, 1146], [5, 1589, 1146, 629, 107, 30, 870, 1146], [0, 1146, 153, 30, 0, 215, 10, 64, 0, 213]], [[6, 68, 1295, 7, 899, 33, 0, 215, 311, 7, 26, 46, 71, 629, 34, 0, 311, 30, 6, 7, 494, 241], [10, 880, 59800, 44934, 630, 107, 30, 44934, 12718], [44934, 30, 6, 150, 0, 629, 5, 630, 311]], [[311, 511]], [[6, 77, 1295, 7, 311, 511, 61, 69, 6636, 5521, 242, 131, 77, 1213, 1854, 34339], [10, 880, 6, 77, 1141, 2199, 123, 69, 234, 55, 76, 311, 44, 808, 629, 311, 5, 44, 629, 311], [83, 9553, 4461, 10443, 5, 2362, 6015, 48729, 6636, 67, 107, 511, 71, 311, 4, 9553, 4461, 342, 6015, 5, 44, 964, 86, 30, 311, 37116, 6015, 4461, 190, 0, 311, 3, 150, 3, 71, 6155]], [[311, 3600]], [[6, 77, 1295, 894, 311, 326, 25, 299], [6, 181, 291, 123, 77, 311, 30, 190, 25, 0, 5489], [6, 77, 1295, 311, 30, 190, 25, 7, 4029], [6, 68, 1295, 7, 311, 273, 102, 0, 3792, 824, 44, 964, 43, 30, 117], [7, 2232, 107, 30, 455, 7, 311, 7151, 113, 3792, 824, 0, 2232, 43, 30, 7, 6618, 1749, 46, 1606]], [[77, 1295, 1566, 455, 69, 7, 311, 3, 7, 2694], [10, 880, 63, 30, 84, 311, 117, 2926, 5450, 9517, 18094, 46, 2120, 6, 623, 69, 311], [34, 6, 77, 1295, 2694, 311, 107, 30, 219]], [[], [10613, 16345, 6252, 34339], []], [[6, 77, 1032, 5, 1295, 81, 86, 1361, 83, 7, 1388, 30, 7, 899, 311, 46, 36, 21, 120, 662, 22, 0, 6252, 46, 4927, 4, 47, 16345], [63, 30, 77, 68, 13544, 4467], [10, 880, 109, 327, 311, 30, 159, 60, 3, 87, 21401]], [[], [234, 3, 311, 698, 7398, 34339]], [[6, 77, 1295, 69, 234, 311, 61, 39, 580, 236, 68], [6, 68, 1295, 69, 234, 44, 7398], [6, 77, 68, 1295, 69, 234, 44, 698, 629, 1282, 34339, 61, 39, 580, 236, 68]], [[], [9106, 3, 311, 698, 7398, 34339], []], [[311, 5418]], [[582, 1812, 3, 311, 30, 190, 7, 1065, 372, 21, 12, 38, 4679, 4, 4686, 7, 311, 4686, 392, 311, 147, 401, 44, 261, 311, 1318, 1726, 311, 46, 311, 6, 216, 1336, 3964, 3, 48, 311, 107, 191, 219, 488, 4686, 20]], [[], [699, 311]], [[110, 77, 69, 107, 3008, 4, 5708, 7, 699, 311, 10, 130, 30355, 3, 1247, 39, 1568, 0, 699, 311, 39, 30, 455, 4, 30, 7, 10728, 68, 33, 190, 4, 4686, 44, 699, 311, 699, 311, 4926, 122]], [[6, 0, 711, 1032, 311, 6622, 30, 1140, 27115, 6, 18681, 17, 0, 6252, 212, 86, 30, 27115, 7, 3504, 279, 30, 5449, 34, 86, 52, 30, 13502], [212, 36, 10492, 30, 802, 1446, 6, 0, 711, 1067, 3, 9336]], [[4103, 3, 311]], [[4874, 10395, 8579, 10155, 2663]], [[1469, 86, 30, 22943, 24060, 86, 399, 45820, 46, 11865]]]}, {"title": "Japanese names", "text": "Here are some things that are often found in Japanese names today. In the past, people went by different rules.  \n\n'''1. Number of parts of a name'''\n\nJapanese names have two parts. One is the family name and the other is the given name. \n\n\"Suzuki Ichiro\" is a name of a Japanese person. Suzuki is the family name, and Ichiro is the first name. In the Japanese language, the family name comes first, and the given name comes second. (It is like writing Smith John, instead of John Smith.)\n\nOnly some members of the royal family do not have a family name. \n\n'''2. Relations with names of parents and other relatives'''\n\nA newborn baby gets a family name from their parents. The parents have the same family name. So, a son of Ono Yoko (female) and Ono Ken (male) is Ono something. \n\nThe family name Ono is mostly shared by the paternal (male) part of the family. So Ono Ken's parents have the family name Ono, but Ono Yoko's parents probably do not. \n\n'''3. Name changes'''\n\nNames of people change when they marry and divorce. It is a custom in many parts of the world that women change their family name to that of their new husband when they marry. However, in Europe and North America especially, many women no longer do this even though their mothers and grandmothers may have. Sometimes, the man will take the woman's family name. \n\n'''4.

It has a land area of 70 sq. miles (184 km<sup>2</sup>). It is the oldest of the eight main islands.\n\nThe whole island is owned by the Robinson family. They bought it from the Kingdom of Hawaii for $10,000. It was said that the buyer, Elizabeth Sinclair (later Sinclair-Robinson), liked the island better than other places such as Waikiki, Pearl Harbor, and the island of Lanai. There is a small US Navy base where a handful of Navy people work.\n\nThe island has a few hundred permanent inhabitants. Almost all of them are native Hawaiians. They support themselves largely with small family farms. Many work for the ranch owned by the Robinsons. The native Hawaiians lead a rural, low-tech life. They speak the Hawaiian language and keep traditions alive. This is because Ms. Sinclair promised to help preserve Hawaiian culture and tradition when she bought the island. Niihau is the only one of the Hawaiian islands where the Hawaiian language is the main language.\n\nNiihau is also known as the \"Forbidden Island\". This is due to the fact that until recently, the island was off-limits to all but family members, US Navy personnel, government officials and expressly invited guests. Now, tourists can go on one of a limited number of supervised tours or hunting safaris.\n\nOn the beaches of the island are found shells which are the only shells to be classified as gems. Niihau shells and the jewelry made from them are very popular. Many, especially those with darker and richer color, are collectors items.

People cut down trees, mine ores, and grow crops. Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do.

Deeper inside the layers of gas, however, the temperature rises slowly. Like Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the differences are larger: Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is strong enough to create the fastest winds seen in the Solar System. Several possible explanations have been suggested, including radiogenic heating from the planet's core, the continued radiation into space of leftover heat made by infalling matter during the planet's birth, and gravity waves breaking above the tropopause.<ref>\nMcHugh, J.

There is likely to be a core, thought to be about 15 Earth masses, made up of molten rock and metal surrounded by a mixture of rock, water, ammonia, and methane. The heavy pressures keep the icy part of this surrounding mixture as solids, in spite of the large temperatures near the core. The atmosphere, extending about 10 to 20% of the way towards the center, is mostly hydrogen and helium at high altitudes. More mixtures of methane, ammonia, and water are found in the lower areas of the atmosphere. Very slowly this darker and hotter area blends into the superheated liquid interior.

The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. However, on November 2, 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet's northern hemisphere. The reason why the Great Dark Spot has disappeared is unknown. One possible theory is that heat transfer from the planet's core disrupted the atmospheric balance and existing circulation patterns. The '''Scooter''' is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. Its nickname was given when it was first noticed in the months leading up to the ''Voyager'' encounter in 1989: it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot. Later images showed clouds that moved even faster than Scooter. The Wizard's Eye/''Dark Spot 2'' is another southern cyclonic storm, the second most strongest storm seen during the 1989 encounter. It originally was completely dark, but as ''Voyager'' came closer to the planet, a bright core developed and is seen in most of the highest resolution images.\n\nUnlike other gas giants, Neptune's atmosphere shows the presence of high clouds making shadows on a thick cloud deck below. Though Neptune's atmosphere is much more active than that of Uranus, both planets are made up of the same gases and ices. Uranus and Neptune are not exactly the same type of gas giants like to Jupiter and Saturn, but are rather ice giants, meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices.

Neptune's planetary rings have a weird \"clumpy\" arrangement. Although the cause is currently unknown but some scientists think that it may be because of the gravitational contact with small moons that orbit near them.\n\nProof that the rings are incomplete first began in the mid-1980s, when stellar occultation were found to rarely show an extra \"blink\" just before or after the planet occulted the star. Pictures from ''Voyager 2'' in 1989 solved the problem, when the ring system was found to have several faint rings. The farthest ring, Adams, has three famous arcs now named ''Libert\u00e9'', ''Egalit\u00e9'', and ''Fraternit\u00e9'' (Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity).\n\nThe existence of arcs is very hard to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a single ring in a very short time. The gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring, are now thought to have created the arcs.\n\nSeveral other rings were discovered by the ''Voyager'' cameras.

The probe also discovered the Great Dark Spot, although it has now disappeared after when the Hubble Space Telescope took pictures of Neptune in 1994. Originally thought to be a large cloud or cyclonic storm system, it was later guessed just to be a hole in the visible cloud deck.\n\nNeptune turned out to have the strongest winds of all the solar system's gas giants. In the outer regions of the solar system, where the Sun shines over 1000 times fainter than on Earth (still very bright with a magnitude of -21), the last of the four giants did happen as what the scientists actually expected. One might think that the farther a planet is from the Sun, the less energy and heat there would be to create and run the very strong winds around. The winds on Jupiter were already hundreds of kilometres per hour. Rather than seeing slower winds, the scientists found faster winds (over 1600&nbsp;km/h) on more distant Neptune.\n\nOne possible guess for the cause of the faster wind speeds is that if enough energy is produced, turbulence is created, which slows the winds down (like those of Jupiter). At Neptune however, there is so little solar energy that once winds are started they meet very little resistance, and are able to keep very high speeds.

Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524 and English explorer Henry Hudson named the Hudson River in 1609.\n\nNew York City was settled by Europeans from The Netherlands in 1624.

The English took over the colony in 1664 during the second Anglo-Dutch War. They changed the name to '''New York''', to honor the Duke of York, who later became King James II of England and James VII of Scotland.  The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting.\n\nBy the time the English took New York, there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City, including Breukelen (Brooklyn), Vlissingen (Flushing), and Nieuw Haarlem (Harlem).

The  important Battle of Long Island of the American Revolution was fought in Brooklyn in 1776. New York was the capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1788.

Noah Webster (1758\u20131843) wrote a ''Grammar'', a ''Spelling'' book, and finally an ''American dictionary of the English language''. In the course of this, he proposed a number of simplifications in spelling. In his dictionary, he chose ''s'' over ''c'' in words like ''defense'', he changed the ''re'' to ''er'' in words like ''center'', he dropped one of the Ls in ''traveler''. At first he kept the u in words like colour or favour but dropped it in later editions. He also changed ''tongue'' to ''tung'': that did not stick. His main reason was to help children learn to read and write. Webster's dictionary contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before.\n\nWebster did create a slightly different identity for American English. But, because his efforts left the most glaring problems untackled, his variations make little difference to the way the language is used. An example of the real problems in English orthography is the word ending ''-ough'', which is pronounced several different ways: tough, bough, cough... The root causes of spelling variation are historical, and loan words come with their own (foreign) spelling. Either all French loan words should be left as they were, or they all should be changed. Either we should move wholesale to a more phonetic spelling, or not. This was proposed by many people since Webster, such as George Bernard Shaw, who proposed a new phonetic alphabet for English. In some cases Webster's changes have been widely adopted in Britain: the spelling ''programme'' came from the French; US ''program'' is clearly simpler, and more consistent with word endings in English. In our modern world, English orthography is still a problem. In some countries (notably, France) a national committee can give advice and direction as to spelling. English has long escaped from national custody.\n\n* Spelling, though important, is less important than how the language is used in practice. The differences between British and American English in use are more to do with idiom, slang and vocabulary than they are to do with spelling. In this respect, spelling in writing or print is a bit like pronunciation in speech. They are the necessary outer clothes, but the inner substance is more important.\n* In Wikipedia (note the spelling), articles may be in either American or British English, but should be consistent within each article.

People who learn a second language tend to think that their first (native) language is the easiest. However, for the learner, programmatic languages, with well-defined rules, are easier to start with than English. The spelling of the English language is by far the most irregular of all alphabetic spellings and thus the most difficult to learn. English is, in its origin, a Germanic language. From its early roots as Anglo-Saxon, it has borrowed words from many other languages: French (a Romance language) and Latin are the most frequent donors to English.\n\nLanguages that use phonetic spelling are easier to learn to spell than others.

Other letters were added later.\n# After the Norman conquest, French scribes introduced new spellings.\n# Printing. Many of the early printers came from the continent of Europe, and brought other spelling norms to England. But, although print stabilised spelling, pronunciation continued to change. \n# Printing coincided with the ''Great Vowel Shift'' at the end of Middle English (end 14th to 15th centuries). To avoid complex details, here is what happened: over a century, the pronunciation of all the vowels changed, and is still not standard throughout Britain. In any event, the spelling of thousands of words now reflects their pronunciation in Geoffrey Chaucer's time.\n# 16th-century scholars tried to indicate the history of a word by its spelling: the silent 'b' in 'debt' is there to reflect the Latin ''debitum''.\n# More loan words added in the late 16th to early 17th century, such as ''pneumonia'', ''idiosyncrasy'', ''epitome'', ''cocoa''.\n\nEnglish has a huge number of words, but its spelling comes from many different sources. \"The large and varied lexicon of English has been bought at the expense of an increasingly deversified graphology\".<ref name=\"Crystal\"/><sup>p275</sup>", "paragraphs": [[[48, 3, 0, 747, 53, 33, 30, 12, 793, 1507, 1388, 107, 30, 6252, 1689, 8127], [4988, 5, 30500, 700, 5, 3806, 353, 5, 38998], [1374, 17, 17009, 6252, 107, 30, 27115, 1481, 9296, 30, 27115, 14204], [151, 102, 1067, 53, 88, 33, 30, 2866, 1129], [], [41, 106, 1110, 2077, 49, 1864, 33, 74], [], [], [], [591, 64, 37, 747, 33, 326, 59, 10, 2245, 1247], [711, 33, 30, 511, 10, 0, 76, 4119, 62, 5, 7, 0, 1032, 511, 100, 153, 3, 20, 169, 4403, 17, 494, 9106]], [[187, 30, 77, 3, 0, 1157, 3, 711, 684], [0, 4804, 13837, 3, 0, 711, 1032], [4804], []], [[1447, 7, 14078, 10, 0, 46, 100, 64597, 1507, 3, 167, 711], [68, 1258, 30, 1679, 288], [], [49, 0, 4965, 10762, 348, 34731, 5354, 50, 9106], [7078], [109, 3, 0, 199, 13568, 326, 25, 0, 4944, 3, 525, 5, 938, 68, 6252, 10575, 4, 563], [34, 376, 4610, 25672, 6252, 16345, 660, 4, 511], [7078, 12945, 17, 0, 353, 18105, 3251, 22, 0, 156, 3, 699, 711, 156, 4, 589], [4, 1566, 1688, 4602, 187, 30, 102, 1927, 74, 7, 589, 0, 16345, 3, 64, 0, 18105, 511, 5, 30, 149, 36, 1224, 983, 695], [6, 130, 770, 0, 6252, 3, 4119, 3, 1388, 114, 4118, 44, 16345, 6, 12070, 42644, 79], [589, 6104, 841, 4, 4485, 0, 299, 3, 7, 1388, 21, 47, 6252, 0, 5326, 1556, 6, 1389, 30, 63, 4, 4118, 0, 1909], [56, 2264, 1388, 1679, 6, 0, 288, 4, 199, 589, 125, 7, 10897, 125011, 34446, 11732]], [[711, 33, 7, 1324, 30355, 3, 1388, 34, 47, 6252, 326, 25, 109, 494, 1173], [], [0, 426, 5, 7038, 28256, 3, 711, 33, 30, 987, 22, 0, 5740, 3, 7, 2113], []]]}, {"title": "Differences between languages", "text": "Some languages have a high correspondence between phonemes and letters.

There are many different 'philosophies', because all of these questions have many different answers according to different people. Not all philosophies ask the same questions. These are the questions that are usually asked by philosophers from the Western world:\n\n'''Metaphysics''':\n\nMetaphysics is sometimes split up into ontology (the philosophy of real life and living things), the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of religion; but these sub-branches are very close together.\n\n''Ontology'':\n* What is the world that we see around us? (What is reality?)\n** Is there more to the world than just what we see or hear? \n** If nobody sees something happening, does that mean that it did not happen?\n** What does it mean to say that something is possible? Do other worlds exist?\n* Is there anything very special about being a human being or being alive at all?\n** If not, why do some people think that there is?\n* What is space? What is time?\n\n''The philosophy of mind'':\n* What is a mind?\n* What is a body?\n* What is consciousness?\n* Do people make choices, or can they only choose to do one thing? (Do people have free will?)\n* What makes words or ideas meaningful? (What is the relation between meaningful words or ideas and the things that they mean?)\n\n''The philosophy of religion'':\n* Do people have souls?\n* Is there a God who created the Universe?\n\n'''In epistemology''':\n\n* What is knowledge? \n* How can we know anything?\n* What is science?\n* What is truth?\n\n'''In ethics''':\n* What are right and wrong, good and bad?\n* Should people do some things and not others?\n* What is justice?\n\n'''In aesthetics''':\n* What is beauty? What if one person thinks a painting is beautiful, but another person thinks the painting is ugly? Can the painting be beautiful and ugly at the same time?\n* Are true things beautiful?\n* Are good things beautiful?\n* What is art? We commonly think that a sculpture in a museum is art. If a sculptor sculpts a sculpture of a rock from clay, and puts it in a museum, many would call it art. But what if a person picks up a rock from the ground - is the rock a piece of art?\n\n'''In logic''':\n* What do the words we use mean?\n* How can we say things (especially ideas) in a way that only has one meaning?\n* Can all ideas be expressed using language?\n* How does the truth of an argument's premise affect the truth of its conclusion?\n* How can we reason correctly? \n\n'''In axiology''':\n* What has value?\n* Is time really money? or have we made it so?\n* Does love, beauty, or justice hold any value?\n\nOther divisions include eschatology, teleology and theology.

Very few people would dispute this. It is easy to argue that philosophy is a good thing, because it helps people to think more clearly. Philosophy helps people to understand the world and the way people act and think. Philosophers believe that asking philosophical questions is useful because it brings wisdom and helps people to learn about the world and each other. Some philosophers might even argue that the question \"Is philosophy good or bad?\" is a philosophical question itself.\n\nHowever, some people think that philosophy is harmful, as philosophy encourages free-thinking and often questions the beliefs that others hold. For example, philosophies such as some existentialist views say that there is no meaning to life or human existence, except the meaning that we make up or invent. People from some religions do not agree with the beliefs of existentialism.\n\nIt should be noted that every major science, including physics, biology, and chemistry are all disciplines that originally were considered philosophy. As speculation and analysis about nature became more developed, these subjects branched away. This is a process that continues even today; psychology only split in the past century. In our own time, subjects such as consciousness studies, decision theory, and applied ethics have increasingly found independence from philosophy as a whole.

They try to find answers to those questions. Some thinkers find it very hard to find those words that best describe the ideas they have. When they find answers to some of these questions philosophers often have the same problem, that is how to best tell the answers they found to other people. Depending on the meaning of the words they use, the answers change. \n\nSome philosophers are full-time thinkers (called academics), who work for universities or colleges. These philosophers write books and articles about philosophy and teach classes about philosophy to university or college students.\n\nOther philosophers are just \"hobby\" thinkers who think about philosophy during their free time. A small number of hobby thinkers have thought so much about philosophy that they are able to write articles for philosophy magazines. Other people approach philosophy from another job. For example, monks, artists, and scientists may think about philosophical ideas and questions.\n\nMost philosophers work by asking questions and looking for good definitions (meanings) of words to help them understand what a question means.\n\nSome philosophers say the only thing needed to answer a question is to find out what it means. The only thing that makes philosophical questions (such as those above) difficult is that people do not really know what they mean Ludwig Wittgenstein held this view.\n\nPhilosophers often use both real and imaginary examples to make a point. For example, they may write about a real or fictional person in order to show what they think a good person or a bad person is like.\n\nSome philosophers look for the simplest way to answer a question and say that is probably the right answer. This is a process called Occam's razor. Others believe that complicated answers to questions can also be right. For an example of a philosophical problem, see the God paradox.\n\nPhilosophers use logic to solve problems and answer questions. Logical consistency is a cornerstone of any acceptable theory. Philosophers who disagree with a theory will often try to find a logical contradiction in a theory. If they find a contradiction, this gives them a reason to reject that theory. If they do not find an inconsistency, the philosopher might show that the theory leads to a conclusion which is either unacceptable or ridiculous.

In the International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French '''S'''yst\u00e8me '''I'''nternational), the kilogram is the basic unit of mass, the metre is the basic unit of length, the second is the basic unit of time, and the ampere is the basic unit of electric current.\n\nIn addition to these four units, there are three other ones: the mole, which is the unit of the quantity of matter, the candela which measures the luminous intensity (the power of lighting) and the kelvin, the unit of temperature.\n\nPhysics studies how things move, and the forces that make them move. For example, velocity and acceleration are used by physics to show how things move. Also, physicists study the forces of gravity, electricity, magnetism and the forces that hold things together.\n\nPhysics studies very large things, and very small things. For instance, physicists can study stars, planets and galaxies but could also study small pieces of matter, such as atoms and electrons.They may also study sound, light and other waves.

Sometimes experiments are done to explore nature, and in other cases experiments are performed to produce data to compare with the predictions of theories.\n\nSome other fields in physics like astrophysics and geophysics are mostly observational sciences because most of their data has to be collected passively instead of through experimentation.

In this way, theoretical physicists often use tools from mathematics. Theoretical physics often can involve creating quantitative predictions of physical theories, and comparing these predictions quantitatively with data. Theoretical physics sometimes creates models of physical systems before data is available to test and support these models.\n\nThese two main activities in physics, data collection, theory production and testing, use many different skills. This has led to a lot of specialization in physics, and the introduction, development and use of tools from other fields. For example, theoretical physicists use mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and probability and computer software in their work. Experimental physicists develop instruments and techniques for collecting data, using engineering and computer technology and many other fields of technology. Often the tools from these other areas are not quite appropriate for the needs of physics, and need to be changed or more advanced versions have to be made.\n\nIt is frequent for new physics to be discovered if experimental physicists do an experiment that current theories cannot explain, or for theoretical physicists to generate theories which can then be put to the test by experimental physicists.\n\nExperimental physics, engineering and technology are related.

The law that \"you must not drink alcohol while driving a car\" stops people from drunk driving, which could kill people. The law \"you must wear a helmet on a motorcycle\" makes sure that people protect themselves\n\nThe government can also control people and what happens in a country in other ways besides making laws.\n* For example, how the government spends its money makes a big difference in what people will do or what will happen to people. If the government spends a lot of money on hospitals and nurses, the people will probably become healthier.\n* Also, if people like their government, or think that their government is wise, they may do something just because their government says it is a good thing to do. Governments often make posters or television advertisements that encourage people to stop smoking cigarettes or eat more fruits and vegetables.\n\nPolitics is often compared to ethics (ideas about right and wrong). Ethics is a more abstract study of right and wrong. Ethics is usually more concerned with principle than law or politics or diplomacy, so many people think ethics is not practical.

Profanities can also be called curse (\"cuss\") words, dirty words, bad words, foul language, obscenity, obscene language, or expletives. It can be called swearing, although this also has a normal meaning of making a \"solemn promise\". A profanity usually refers to religion, sex, or bodily functions. These are things that people feel very strongly about. In some languages, such as French, there is more profanity about religion than most other topics.

Saying \u201cGod!\u201d or \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d as an expression of surprise or annoyance is considered by many to be blasphemy, mostly because one of the Ten Commandments says not to use God's name \"in vain\" (without substance or without relevance).

It currently has more than 1.4 billion people (as of 2017), which is more than any other country in the world.<ref name=\"Census2010\" /> It covers an area of 9.6 million square kilometers.\n\nThe capital city is Beijing, and Shanghai is the city with the most people living in it. Along with the cities of Tianjin and Chongqing, these four cities are \"municipalities\" directly controlled by the national government. Two other cities are given the status of \"special administrative region\" (SAR). They are Hong Kong, which was once a colony of the United Kingdom and given back to China in 1997; and Macau, which Portugal gave back in 1999. These two cities remain highly autonomous, or have much of their own power. Aside from the \"municipalities\" and the \"SAR's\", there are 23 provinces and five \"autonomous regions\", or regions with more law-making rights than the provinces and with many people of a minority group population. They are the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Tibet Autonomous Region or Xizang Autonomous Region, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region or Nei Mongol Autonomous Region, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.\n\nIn the SAR's, the central government is responsible for defense and foreign affairs but not the daily operations for 50 years. PRC claims Taiwan as one of its many provinces.  However, PRC does not have control of Taiwan which has an entirely different political system and officially known as the Republic of China (Taiwan).", "paragraphs": [[[0, 69, 874, 3, 132], [21748], [30, 7, 48, 165, 92, 6, 322, 831, 9909, 21, 0, 1501, 165, 3, 132], [20, 30, 238, 13, 441], [20, 839, 33, 181, 73, 160, 69, 7, 3, 42, 30, 181, 73, 130, 68, 123, 6, 0], [], [20, 1333, 7, 237, 3, 93, 1249, 10511]], [[0, 351, 115, 30, 942, 5, 2205, 30, 0, 115, 17, 0, 181, 69, 682, 6, 20], [385, 17, 0, 115, 3, 11575, 5, 13902, 37, 133, 115, 30, 2475, 1823, 424, 21, 0, 121, 78], [55, 68, 115, 30, 455, 0, 1416, 3, 557, 2352, 368, 10405], [39, 30, 729, 727, 42, 30, 442, 7, 4717, 3, 0, 104, 1859, 5, 455, 137, 4, 132, 6, 5, 10275, 42, 3010, 455, 137, 6], [158, 55, 115, 944, 1786, 4962, 46, 33, 181, 3, 44, 261, 268], [2970, 25, 0, 2475, 5, 0, 10405, 63, 30, 624, 5, 174, 4962, 368, 46, 368, 17, 181, 264, 159, 248, 73, 0, 624, 5, 17, 109, 69, 3, 7, 2342, 129, 485], [39, 30, 0, 9409, 46718, 4962, 368, 0, 4569, 4962, 368, 46, 201872, 4962, 368, 0, 16894, 24290, 4962, 368, 0, 4527, 8688, 4962, 368, 46, 68941, 22237, 4962, 368, 5, 0, 29457, 9709, 4962, 368]], [[6, 0, 10405, 0, 323, 78, 30, 1442, 10, 475, 5, 205, 4160, 34, 36, 0, 777, 957, 10, 62], [21748, 1547, 694, 7, 48, 3, 47, 109, 624], [212, 21748, 14219, 36, 33, 424, 3, 694, 42, 33, 7, 3462, 494, 209, 278, 5, 2391, 346, 7, 0, 874, 3, 132, 694]]]}, {"title": "History", "text": "<!-- since we don't have a History of the PRC article-->\nChina has one of the world's oldest civilizations and has the oldest continuous civilization.<ref></ref> It has archaeological evidence over 5,000 years old.<ref name=\"Hagg2\"></ref> It also has one of the world's oldest writing systems (and the oldest in use today), and is viewed as the source of many major inventions.<ref name=\"Hagg2\" />", "paragraphs": [[[108, 53, 88, 33, 7, 299, 3, 0, 21748], [132, 33, 48, 3, 0, 85, 167, 9390, 5, 33, 0, 167, 6860], [20, 33, 8456, 906, 74, 62], [], [], [20, 52, 33, 48, 3, 0, 85, 167, 2432, 278, 5, 0, 167, 6, 234, 373, 5, 30, 1139, 7, 0, 1173, 3, 109, 224], [], []]]}, {"title": "Ancient (2100&nbsp;B.C. - 1500 A.D.)", "text": "Ancient China was one of the first civilizations and was active since the 2nd millennium BC as a feudal society.\n\nChinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing,<ref name=\"Hagg2\" /> with the others being Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley civilization, the Maya civilization, the Minoan civilization of ancient Greece, and Ancient Egypt.<ref></ref> It reached its golden age during the Tang Dynasty (c.

This was because Spain found a lot of silver in the newly explored continents of North and South America. Silver was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.\n\nBy the time of the Renaissance, European powers started to take over other countries in Asia. During this time the opium epidemic was growing in China. Foreign traders (primarily British) had been illegally exporting opium mainly from India to China since the 18th century, but that trade grew dramatically from about 1820. The resulting widespread addiction in China was causing serious social and economic disruption there.<ref></ref> This led to what is now known as the first opium war. The first '''Opium''' '''War''' between China and Great Britain lasted from 1839 to 1842. The conflict was the result of years of attempts by the British to exploit China as a market for British goods. Britain eventually relied on its superior military capabilities to force open the lucrative Chinese market, while imposing an illicit trade in '''opium''' on the Chinese people.<ref></ref>\n\nWhile China was never actually taken over by Europeans, many European countries, such as Britain and France built spheres of influence in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries, by the Qing Dynasty, it had fallen behind other countries in technology, and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1912, the Qing dynasty was overthrown by the Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang, a nationalist party, and the Republic of China established. Over time, Marxist ideas grew popular and the Communist party was formed.\n\nThe Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomintang (Nationalists) of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on September 21, 1949.<ref name=prcfounding/><ref name=prcf2/><ref name=prcf3/>\n\nIn 1927, the Chinese Civil War began as the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communists fought one another.\n\nAmidst the turmoil brewing between the Nationalist and Communist parties who were vying for control of China at the time, Japan had launched an invasion of Manchuria in 1934 and began to creep steadily inland.  China, the Nationalist party in particular, owed Japan immense amounts of money, which they could not pay whilst infused in their own civil war. The Treaty of Versailles promised the Japanese government land in China in return for forgiveness of their debt. This ended up not being a popular sentiment and was rallied against all over the country, and most famously during the May 4th Movement in Beijing in 1919. When the Chinese did not readily give up their rights to their land, Japan tried to take it by force. This was the beginning of World War II in the Pacific Theater.<ref>Mitter, Rana. Modern China: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press inc. 2008</ref>\n\nBy 1949, the Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party had gained control over mainland China and Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People's Republic of China. Chiang Kai-shek and the other nationalists fled to Taiwan.\n\nAs the leader of the People's Republic of China, Mao began many social and economic reform projects with mixed results. The Great Leap Forward, from 1958 to 1961, tried to industrialize China and increase its food production, but resulted in one of the largest famines in history. It is estimated that 45 million people died as a result of this reform project.<ref name=\"Akbar2010\"></ref> In 1966, Mao began the Cultural Revolution to remove capitalist influences from society and government. Major government officials and ordinary citizens were accused of being \"revisionists\" - people who disagreed with some parts of Marxism - or \"counter-revolutionaries\" and were persecuted. Many universities and schools were closed, and historical and religious sites were destroyed. Although the program officially ended in 1969, it continued until Mao's death in 1976.\n\nDuring this time period, the People's Republic of China did not get along with the capitalist countries of the Western world. Beginning in the 1960s, relationships between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union also became increasingly unfriendly in the Sino-Soviet Split. In 1972, to counter the power of the Soviet Union, Mao and Zhou Enlai met with US President Richard Nixon in Beijing. This began to improve relationships between China and the Western world.\n\nAfter Mao's death, there was a power struggle between the Gang of Four and Hua Guofeng, the man Mao had chosen to be the next leader of China. Eventually, Deng Xiaoping, one of the veterans of the revolution, took power. He began a \"Reform and Opening Up\" () campaign. These reforms tried to make the People's Republic of China a modern, industrial - but still socialist - nation by moving towards a market system. Deng's policies would be known as \"socialism with Chinese characteristics.\"\n\nAlthough Deng's policy helped loosen restrictions on citizens, the People's Republic of China continues to have problems with the amount of control the government has over citizens' private lives. In 1979, the one-child policy, which limits most couples to one child, was created because of the overpopulation problem in the People's Republic of China. This policy is highly controversial and many Westerners have criticized it. News and Internet sites are also censored by the government.\n\nIn 1989, the Chinese government used soldiers and tanks to stop a protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square organized by students seeking political reform. This action received worldwide criticism and led to economic sanctions being placed on the Chinese government.\n\nIn August 2008, China hosted the Summer Olympics for the first time.", "paragraphs":

It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later.

On the first day of the Chinese New Year, people call on friends and relatives. Because most people watch the special performances on CCTV all the night on New Year's Eve and don't go to bed until 12:00&nbsp;AM, they usually get up later in the next day. The fifth day of the Chinese New Year is the day to welcome the god of Wealth (Chinese:\u8d22\u795e\u7237), many people make and eat dumplings (Chinese:\u997a\u5b50.  Pinyin: Jaozi). They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck.  The last day of the Chinese New Year is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon. People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere. After that, they eat sweet dumpling (Chinese:\u6c64\u5706,\u5143\u5bb5), a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon.\n\nDragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the Warring States period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats's offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish.  Eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, became what the Chinese do in this festival nowadays.\n\nHeld on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families.

Further analysis of the statement or proposition may reveal a fallacious axiom or some obscure underlying truth. Not all paradoxes are fundamentally incongruous, as some may only appear so. Many famous problems of this kind exist.\n\nA famous paradoxes is called the '''liar's paradox'''.  It is the simple sentence \"This sentence is a lie.\"\n\nIf the sentence is true, then it is a lie, as it says.  But if it is a lie, how can it be true?  A lie cannot also be the truth.  So the sentence being true makes it a lie.\n\nIf the sentence is a lie, then it is not as it says, it is true.  But that is just what the sentence says.  So that makes it true.  So the sentence being a lie makes it true.\n\nThis paradox is not just true in English but in any language powerful enough for a sentence to make a claim about itself.  This is true of mathematics as well.  Paradox can never be removed from any symbol system that makes claims about itself.\n\nAnother example is the statement that \"there is no cabal\".  Only a cabal can know if there is no cabal, so this is either a guess, or, it is a cabal trying to pretend it does not exist.\n\nOther famous examples:\n\n*Xeno's paradox of motion\n*Simpson's paradox in statistics\n\nA paradox can also arise in ethics.  Assuming power over others may sometimes be required to protect them while diminishing their right to autonomy.  This is defined as an  which means \"a paradox arising in ethics\". Similarly, an ethical dilemma may be resolved by re-framing of the problem to reveal the false contradiction. \n\nBecause a paradox forces us to think \"out of the box\", about possibilities other than true or false in logic, right or wrong in morality, it is considered very important in education.

{"title": "Plant", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Plants''' are one of six big groups (kingdoms) of living things. They are autotrophic eukaryotes, which means they have complex cells, and make their own food. Usually they cannot move (not counting growth).\n\nPlants include familiar types such as trees, herbs, bushes, grasses, vines, ferns, mosses, and green algae. The scientific study of plants, known as botany, has identified about 350,000 extant (living) species of plants. Fungi and non-green algae are not classified as plants.\n\nMost plants grow in the ground, with stems in the air and roots below the surface. Some float on water. The root part absorbs water and some nutrients the plant needs to live and grow. These climb the stem and reach the leaves. The evaporation of water from pores in the leaves pulls water through the plant. This is called transpiration.\n\nA plant needs sunlight, carbon dioxide, minerals and water to make food by photosynthesis. A green in plants called chlorophyll traps the energy from the Sun needed to make food. Chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves, inside plastids, which are inside the leaf cells. The leaf can be thought of as a food factory. Leaves of plants vary in shape and size, but they are always the plant organ best suited to capture solar energy. Once the food is made in the leaf, it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as stems and roots.<ref>Asimov, Isaac 1968. ''Photosynthesis''. Basic Books, New York, London. .</ref><ref>Intermediate Learn Science, grades 5-6, by Mike Evans and Linda Ellis</ref>\n\nThe word \"plant\" can also mean the action of putting something in the ground. For example, farmers plant seeds in the field.\n\nPhotosynthesis is a process that is taken place by the leaves on the plant. The leaves are the only parts of a plant that can do this process (as they adapted). This is also known as how the plant gets its food.You can make the process quicker by adding more CO2, light and chlorophyll.", "paragraphs": [[[1982, 30, 48, 3, 228, 365, 129, 1859, 3, 682, 873], [39, 30, 241334, 187906, 42, 1702, 39, 33, 1688, 2114, 5, 159, 44, 261, 565], [1140, 39, 86, 36, 483, 36, 2428, 552]], [[1982, 488, 3478, 1554, 125, 7, 2654, 12305, 272, 4614, 17536, 26516, 8897, 5, 989, 80866], [0, 2440, 806, 3, 1189, 346, 7, 23215, 33, 3559, 59, 17935, 682, 1024, 3, 1189], [17753, 5, 1337, 989, 80866, 30, 36, 24558, 7, 1189]], [[96, 1189, 2274, 6, 0, 17222, 17, 4342, 6, 0, 325, 5, 5440, 1268, 0, 2283], [77, 11947, 13, 430], [0, 5440, 153, 11006, 430, 5, 77, 28709, 0, 1189, 408, 4, 682, 5, 2274], [158, 5715, 0, 4342, 5, 1022, 0, 891], [0, 32979, 3, 430, 25, 33271, 6, 0, 891, 2933, 430, 131, 0, 1189], [37, 30, 580, 137482]], [[7, 1189, 408, 13738, 4136, 8107, 7754, 5, 430, 4, 159, 565, 21, 41143], [7, 989, 6, 1189, 580, 58386, 8784, 0, 634, 25, 0, 1662, 408, 4, 159, 565], [58386, 30, 1246, 596, 6, 891, 1038, 179850, 42, 30, 1038, 0, 7501, 2114], [0, 7501, 86, 30, 269, 3, 7, 7, 565, 2726], [2200, 3, 1189, 7038, 6, 3030, 5, 1275, 34, 39, 30, 690, 0, 1189, 6480, 143, 2536, 4, 3388, 4708, 634], [442, 0, 565, 30, 159, 6, 0, 7501, 20, 30, 1878, 4, 0, 68, 153, 3, 0, 1189, 125, 7, 4342, 5, 37343, 9712], [41143], [2007, 1145, 50, 196, 516], [], [], [8529, 2368, 1121, 2833, 21, 1589, 5164, 5, 6763], []], [[0, 1388, 1189, 86, 52, 1702, 0, 608, 3, 7778, 645, 6, 0, 17222], [10, 880, 5769, 1189, 3404, 6, 0, 610]], [[41143, 30, 7, 546, 12, 30, 190, 241, 21, 0, 891, 13, 0, 1189], [0, 891, 30, 0, 91, 153, 3, 7, 1189, 12, 86, 88, 37, 546, 7, 39, 10232], [37, 30, 52, 346, 7, 197, 0, 1189, 169, 47, 565], [81, 86, 159, 0, 546, 2582, 21, 1679, 181, 897, 5, 58386]]]}, {"title": "Types of plants", "text": "Green algae:\n*Chlorophyta\n*Charophyta\n\nLand plants (embryophytes)\n* Non-vascular plants (bryophytes):\n** Liverworts\n** Mosses\n** Hornworts\n** \u2020Horneophytopsida\n*Vascular plants (tracheophytes)\n** Lycopodiophyta\u2014clubmosses\n** Pteridophyta: the ferns\n*** Pteridopsida: the typical ferns\n*** Sphenopsida: the horsetails\n*** Marattiopsida: a divergent group of ferns\n*** Psilotopsida: sister-group to all other ferns\n** \u2020Rhyniophyta\u2014rhyniophytes\n** \u2020Zosterophyllophyta\u2014zosterophylls\n** \u2020Trimerophytophyta\u2014trimerophytes\n** \u2020Progymnospermophyta\n** Seed plants (spermatophytes)\n*** \u2020Pteridospermatophyta: the seed ferns\n*** Pinophyta: the conifers\n*** Cycadophyta: the cycads\n*** Ginkgophyta: the ginkgos\n*** Gnetophyta: sister group to the Angiosperms\n*** Magnoliophyta or Angiosperms (flowering plants)\n**** Dicotyledons\n**** Monocotyledons\n*\u2020Nematophytes", "paragraphs": [[[989, 80866, 374149], []], [[607, 1189], [1337, 24001, 1189, 281408], [], [129230], [], [53697], [], [306599], [], [], [24001, 1189], [], [365136], [], [0, 26516], [], [], [0, 3682, 26516], [], [], [0, 167190], [], [], [7, 25990, 129, 3, 26516], [], [], [2003, 129, 4, 64, 68, 26516], [], [], [385885], [], [], [], [], [], [3404, 1189], [], [0, 3404, 26516], [0, 52632], [], [], [0, 137720], [], [], [0, 70742], [], [], [2003, 129, 4, 0, 96616], [], [46, 96616, 6504, 1189], [], [], [271391], [], [], [258620]]]}, {"title": "The plant food factory", "text": "At least some plant cells contain photosynthetic organelles (plastids) which enable them to make food for themselves.

It is composed of the ''filament'' (a stalk) that holds the anther, which produces the pollen. Pollen is needed for plants to produce seeds. The carpel is the female part of the flower. The top part of the carpel contains the stigma. The style is the neck of the carpel. The ovary is the swollen area at the bottom of the carpel. The ovary produces the seeds. The sepal is a leaf that protects a flower as a bud.\n\nThe process by which pollen gets transferred from one flower to another flower is called pollination. This transfer can happen in different ways. Insects such as bees are attracted to bright, scented flowers. When bees go into the flower to gather nectar, the spiky pollen sticks to their back legs. The sticky stigma on another flower catches the pollen when the bee lands or flies nearby it.\n\nSome flowers use the wind to carry pollen.

{"title": "Probability", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Probability''' is a part of mathematics. It has to do with chance, the study of things that might happen or might not happen. \n\nFor example, using probability, you can show that if you throw a coin up in the air and let it land, half of the time it will land with one side facing up, and half the time with the other side facing up. Many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side, and something else on the other side. Often people call the side with the face \"heads\", and the other side \"tails\".\n\n'''The probability (p) of an event is always between zero (impossible) and one (certain).'''\n\nIf we roll a die (plural: dice), then the chance that it will land on 1 is 1/6 (This is because there are 6 numbers on a die). Also, the chance it will land on 2 is 1/6. This is because it can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. \nThe chance of any number between 1 and 6 landing is 1. Every time we roll the die, it will always land on a number between 1 and 6.\n\nProbability can be figured out using mathematics. For example, if you roll six dice, the chance of you getting a number more than ten is not obvious, but can be figured out using math and science.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about chance is that to figure out the probability that two things will both happen you multiply their two probabilities together. For instance, suppose that you want to know the probability of rolling two dice and getting a certain combination (it could be two 6s or a 3 then a 5, just any two). The possibility of getting a 3 is one in six (\u2159) and the possibility of getting a 5 is also one in six, so the chances of getting a 3 then a 5 is \u2159\u00d7\u2159=\u215f36. If that number is expressed as somewhere between 0 and 1, it equals 0.027...7, which is fairly low. The possibility of getting a 3, then a 5, and then a 2 would be \u2159\u00d7\u2159\u00d7\u2159=\u215f216 or 0.00463, which is a much lower probability.", "paragraphs": [[[10227, 30, 7, 153, 3, 6510], [20, 33, 4, 88, 17, 1019, 0, 806, 3, 873, 12, 107, 1927, 46, 107, 36, 1927]], [[10, 880, 234, 10227, 81, 86, 273, 12, 83, 81, 3375, 7, 9569, 60, 6, 0, 325, 5, 886, 20, 607, 343, 3, 0, 79, 20, 43, 607, 17, 48, 437, 621, 60, 5, 343, 0, 79, 17, 0, 68, 437, 621, 60], [109, 9569, 33, 7, 1835, 3, 0, 621, 3, 7, 1613, 899, 13, 48, 437, 5, 645, 1726, 13, 0, 68, 437], [456, 69, 580, 0, 437, 17, 0, 621, 362, 5, 0, 68, 437, 6780]], [[0, 10227, 3420, 3, 7, 770, 30, 690, 118, 4014, 3173, 5, 48, 1192]], [[83, 53, 3301, 7, 2357, 17525, 2357, 127, 0, 1019, 12, 20, 43, 607, 13, 30], [37, 30, 113, 63, 30, 223, 13, 7, 2357], [52, 0, 1019, 20, 43, 607, 13, 30], [37, 30, 113, 20, 86, 607, 13, 46], [0, 1019, 3, 130, 30355, 118, 5, 607, 30], [359, 79, 53, 3301, 0, 2357, 20, 43, 690, 607, 13, 7, 30355, 118, 5]], [[10227, 86, 30, 1265, 66, 234, 6510], [10, 880, 83, 81, 3301, 228, 2357, 0, 1019, 3, 81, 169, 7, 30355, 181, 73, 1705, 30, 36, 4398, 34, 86, 30, 1265, 66, 234, 7460, 5, 1121]], [[48, 3, 0, 181, 560, 873, 59, 1019, 30, 12, 4, 1265, 66, 0, 10227, 12, 55, 873, 43, 150, 1927, 81, 25172, 44, 55, 10227, 600], [10, 3233, 12073, 12, 81, 303, 4, 346, 0, 10227, 3, 3301, 55, 2357, 5, 169, 7, 1192, 3398, 20, 86, 30, 55, 46, 7, 127, 7, 120, 130, 55], [0, 2175, 3, 169, 7, 30, 48, 6, 228, 5, 0, 2175, 3, 169, 7, 30, 52, 48, 6, 228, 100, 0, 1019, 3, 169, 7, 127, 7, 30], [83, 12, 30355, 30, 2626, 7, 5530, 118, 5, 20, 3024, 42, 30, 4559, 653], [0, 2175, 3, 169, 7, 127, 7, 5, 127, 7, 54, 30, 46, 42, 30, 7, 181, 653, 10227]]]}, {"title": "Ideas of probablity", "text": "People like Jacob Bernoulli, Pierre-Simon Laplace, or Christiaan Huygens used the word probability, as described above.

In the table, the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number of one, hydrogen. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of  protons in that particular nucleus of an atom. In the periodic table the elements are arranged into ''periods'' and ''groups.'' A row of elements across the table is called a ''period''. Each period has a number; from 1 to 8. Period 1 has only 2 elements in it: hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements. Other periods are longer. Elements in a period have consecutive atomic numbers. \n\nA column of elements down the table is called a ''group''. There are 18 groups in the standard periodic table.  Each group has a number: from 1 to 18. Elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways, according to the number of [valency]] electrons, which gives them similar chemical properties (they behave in similar ways).  For example, group 18 is known as the noble gases because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms. \n\nThere are two systems of group numbers; one using Arabic numerals (1,2,3) and the other using Roman numerals (I, II, III). The Roman numeral names were used in most of the 20th century.  In 1990 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decided to use the new system with Arabic numerals, to replace the two old group systems that used Roman numerals.\n\nThe periodic table has been used by chemists to observe patterns and relationships between elements. There are 3 main groups in in the Periodic Table; metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. For example, elements to the bottom and far left of the table are the most metallic, and elements on the top right are the least metallic. (e.g. cesium is much more metallic than helium). There are also many other patterns and relationships.\n\nThe Periodic Table was invented and arranged by the Russian chemist Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev (1834-1907).

Physiologists can study how organs of an organism work together to make things happen. In human beings, for example, the digestion of food hormones and other chemicals are made by the stomach, liver, and pancreas. Muscle contraction happens because of chemical messages made by nerves of that muscle. By learning how the body functions normally, physiologists and physicians can better understand what happens when organs do not function normally. For example, an understanding of how the thyroid gland functions has helped in treating goitre. Studies of the circulatory system and the nervous system have helped physicians understand and treat such illnesses like heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure.\n\nThe field is usually divided into human physiology,<ref>Hall, John 2011.

The United Kingdom and Switzerland have many local police forces and several national agencies, but no actual national police force.

So most Canadian cities have their own police, while most rural areas are policed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is also the national police.\n\nThe United States has over 17,000 law enforcement agencies. Many areas have four levels of law enforcement agencies. For example, Los Angeles has the Los Angeles Police Department but there are many other agencies that can work in the city.

Most historians believe that ancient Egyptians had no concept of \u03c0 and that the correspondence is a coincidence.<ref name=\"unleashed\">Arndt, J\u00f6rg & Haenel, Christoph 2006.

St. Martins Press, London.</ref> Around 1650  the Egyptian Ahmes gave a value in the ''Rhind Papyrus''. The Babylonians were able to find that the value of pi was slightly greater than 3 by simply making a big circle and then sticking a piece of rope onto the circumference and the diameter, taking note of their distances, and then dividing the circumference by the diameter.\n\nKnowledge of the number pi passed back into Europe and into the hands of the Hebrews, who made the number important in a section of the Bible called the Old Testament. After this, the most common way of trying to find pi was to draw a shape of many sides inside any circle and use the area of the shape to find pi. The Greek philosopher Archimedes, for example, used a polygon shape that had 96 sides in order to find the value of pi, but the Chinese in 500  were able to use a polygon with 16,384 sides to find the value of pi. The Greeks, like Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, were also busy with finding out other properties of the circle, such as how to make squares of circles and squaring the number pi. Since then, many people have been trying to find out more and more exact values of pi.<ref></ref>\n\n\n\nIn the 16th century, better and better ways of finding pi became available such as the complicated formula that the French lawyer Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te developed. The first use of the Greek symbol \"\u03c0\" was in an essay written in 1706 by William Jones.\n\nA mathematician named Lambert also showed in 1761 that the number pi was irrational; that is, it cannot be written as a fraction by normal standards. Another mathematician named Lindeman was also able to show in 1882 that pi was part of the group of numbers known as transcendentals, which are numbers that cannot be the solution to a polynomial equation.<ref></ref>\n\nPi can also be used for figuring out many other things beside circles.<ref name=unleashed/> The properties of pi have allowed it to be used in many other areas of math besides geometry, which studies shapes. Some of these areas are complex analysis, trigonometry, and series.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 1158, 3, 18641, 30, 346, 4, 2359, 792, 16615, 117, 5]], [[29299, 33, 346, 59, 18641, 10, 4119, 3, 62, 113, 39, 33, 30, 161, 17, 4012, 10, 0, 215, 1418, 3, 79], [19685, 7, 167, 7, 0, 77761, 33, 30, 667, 4, 16147, 18641, 4, 109, 9097, 125, 7, 0, 9330, 5], [96, 5063, 733, 12, 2359, 2434, 33, 84, 2986, 3, 38639, 5, 12, 0, 11799, 30, 7, 71637, 273616, 20078], [18641, 21210], [18499, 49695], [11799, 4, 102], []], [[0, 2432, 2978, 4, 18641, 1257, 4], [], [71231, 19339], [7, 299, 3, 18641], [19647, 428], [204], [0, 2434, 374583, 455, 7, 1158, 6, 0, 133878, 32681], [0, 77761, 30, 667, 4, 596, 12, 0, 1158, 3, 18641, 30, 2008, 353, 73, 21, 1481, 159, 7, 365, 4012, 5, 127, 4403, 7, 2365, 3, 11094, 2178, 0, 36403, 5, 0, 8538, 190, 1812, 3, 44, 2296, 5, 127, 6586, 0, 36403, 21, 0, 8538]], [[2489, 3, 0, 30355, 18641, 1280, 137, 75, 525, 5, 75, 0, 823, 3, 0, 7585, 38, 159, 0, 30355, 481, 6, 7, 1519, 3, 0, 5489, 580, 0, 167, 9068], [49, 37, 0, 181, 861, 179, 3, 841, 4, 596, 18641, 30, 4, 1707, 7, 3030, 3, 109, 437, 1038, 130, 4012, 5, 234, 0, 237, 3, 0, 3030, 4, 596, 18641], [0, 1622, 11296, 53223, 10, 880, 234, 7, 45310, 3030, 12, 33, 437, 6, 460, 4, 596, 0, 1158, 3, 18641, 34, 0, 327, 6, 30, 667, 4, 234, 7, 45310, 17, 437, 4, 596, 0, 1158, 3, 18641], [0, 1622, 117, 191275, 3, 30, 52, 4259, 17, 596, 66, 68, 1306, 3, 0, 4012, 125, 7, 197, 4, 159, 1249, 3, 4012, 5, 1249, 0, 30355, 18641], [108, 127, 109, 69, 33, 30, 841, 4, 596, 66, 181, 5, 181, 5159, 1158, 3]], [], [[6, 0, 589, 143, 5, 143, 179, 3, 596, 18641, 399, 779, 125, 7, 0, 17009, 3406, 12, 0, 348, 1387, 16620, 284949, 281809], [0, 234, 3, 0, 1622, 4380, 38639, 30, 6, 7, 9559, 2432, 6, 21, 1074, 1155]], [[7, 16615, 311, 12005, 52, 273, 6, 12, 0, 30355, 18641, 30, 18997], [12, 30, 20, 86, 36, 30, 2432, 7, 7, 9330, 21, 1973, 1224], [170, 16615, 311, 119286, 30, 52, 667, 4, 273, 6, 12, 18641, 30, 153, 3, 0, 129, 3, 223, 346, 7, 42, 30, 223, 12, 86, 36, 30, 0, 2124, 4, 7, 23400]], [[18641, 86, 52, 30, 234, 10, 1265, 66, 109, 68, 873, 7555, 311], [], [0, 1306, 3, 18641, 33, 949, 20, 4, 30, 234, 6, 109, 68, 237, 3, 7460, 3606, 13780, 42, 806, 3030], [77, 3, 37, 237, 30, 1688, 2473, 73930, 5, 281]]]}, {"title": "Pi in real life", "text": "Today, there are different ways to calculate many digits of <math>\\pi</math>.

{"title": "Plastic", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "A '''plastic''' is a material that can change its shape. Many things are made of plastics, usually because making them the right shape is easy. There are many types of plastic. Some can be shaped only when they are freshly made; then they become hard.  Others are thermoplastic and can be softened by heating them. These plastics can be used for 3D printing, because the plastic will become soft enough to form into different shapes, and then become hard again when they cool down.  \n\nMost plastics are man-made; they do not occur in nature. The process of making plastics is usually quite complicated. Most of the materials that are called ''plastic'' are polymers. Polymers are long chains of atoms bonded to each other.  In most plastics, the long chain is a chain of carbon atoms with other atoms attached to them. The different atoms and the shape and length of the chains change how the plastic looks and works. \n\nPeople experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for a very long time. Alexander Parkes, an English inventor (1813-1890), created early form of plastic in 1855. It was hard but flexible and transparent. He called it \"Parkesine\" but now it is called \"Celluloid.\"\n\nOld plastics are usually thrown away and put in landfills. Some plastics release toxic fumes when heated. Some plastics are recycled so they won't become waste. Some plastics have other materials added to them, like glass, because they make the plastic stronger and stiffer.\n\nPlastics are mostly petrochemicals, made from natural gas or from petroleum, a type of oil. Chemical engineers refine the petroleum which goes through a heating process. It develops ethylene and propylene, which are the chemical building blocks for many plastics.

{"title": "Product stewardship", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Product stewardship''' includes waste disposal measures in the distribution of an industrial product.  That is, paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product, and relying on those who sold it to you, to dispose of it.  \n\nThe slightly more specific idea of '''product take-back''' means that the service of waste disposal is paid for at time of purchase.  It is often applied to paint, tires, and other goods that become toxic waste if not disposed of properly.  It is most familiar as the deposit bottle - where one pays for the loan of the bottle at the same time as one purchases what is inside it. The '''container deposit''' charged for a '''deposit bottle''' may be a fee to ''buy'' the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains.  If one returns the bottle, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or recycling.  If not, one has paid the fee, and presumably this can pay for landfill or litter control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle.  Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving.  This is quite common for instance among homeless people.\n\nLegal requirements vary:  the bottle itself may be considered simple property of the purchaser of the contents, or, the purchaser may have some obligation to return the bottle to some depot so it can be recycled or re-used.   For the more toxic items, it is more likely that returning it is required:\n\nThis principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires.  When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become.  In some countries, such as Germany, law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way.  This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally.  In the United States, there have been many class action suits that are effectively product stewardship liability - holding companies responsible for things the product does, which it was never advertised to do.\n\nRather than let liability for these problems be taken up by the public sector or be haphazardly assigned one issue at a time to companies via lawsuits, many accounting reform efforts focus on achieving full cost accounting.  This is the financial reflection of the comprehensive outcome - noting the gains and losses to all parties involved, not just those investing or purchasing.  Such moves have made moral purchasing more attractive, as it avoids liability and future lawsuits.\n\nSo these are partial implementations of a strict service economy ideal.\n\nThose who advocate these measures are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process.  It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) \"commodity\" and \"product\" relationships.", "paragraphs": [[[1459, 21021, 488, 3631, 8717, 1769, 6, 0, 2527, 3, 7, 1271, 1459], [12, 30, 642, 10, 0, 1876, 5, 3734, 8717, 61, 81, 642, 10, 0, 1459, 5, 5656, 13, 12, 38, 1243, 20, 4, 81, 4, 18623, 3, 20]], [[0, 2008, 181, 1902, 1159, 3], [1459, 190, 137, 1702, 12, 0, 270, 3, 3631, 8717, 30, 642, 10, 22, 79, 3, 2502], [20, 30, 456, 3515, 4, 5309, 8813, 5, 68, 219, 12, 399, 6909, 3631, 83, 36, 18623, 3, 5005], [20, 30, 181, 3478, 7, 0, 7803, 6676, 111, 48, 642, 10, 0, 2264, 3, 0, 6676, 22, 0, 215, 79, 7, 48, 2502, 102, 30, 1038, 20], [0, 8304, 7803, 1090, 10, 7, 7803, 6676, 107, 30, 7, 3915, 4, 987, 0, 6676, 5244, 25, 0, 3915, 4, 987, 102, 20, 3540], [83, 48, 498, 0, 6676, 0, 3915, 30, 498, 5, 0, 8048, 390, 498, 0, 6676, 10, 1765, 234, 46, 30563], [83, 36, 48, 33, 642, 0, 3915, 5, 8275, 37, 86, 642, 10, 20609, 46, 18990, 424, 1769, 12, 18623, 3], [203, 7, 1129, 6676], [52, 108, 0, 215, 3915, 86, 30, 5198, 21, 1544, 596, 5, 498, 0, 6676, 20, 30, 861, 10, 69, 4, 5198, 37, 5, 498, 101, 7, 7, 1702, 3, 3981], [37, 30, 1689, 861, 10, 3233, 244, 5473, 69]], [[830, 5902, 7038, 0, 6676, 1003, 107, 30, 1568, 2147, 1306, 3, 0, 34311, 3, 0, 2768, 46, 0, 34311, 107, 33, 77, 7726, 4, 498, 0, 6676, 4, 77, 6686, 100, 20, 86, 30, 30563, 46, 1765, 234], [10, 0, 181, 6909, 6779, 20, 30, 181, 647, 12, 498, 20, 30, 2324]], [[37, 3847, 30, 3515, 191, 9300, 1515, 6676, 4, 5309, 5, 6190, 153, 125, 7, 8813], [61, 2502, 5309, 46, 8813, 6, 109, 241, 48, 6683, 642, 10, 0, 8717, 3, 0, 6909, 3631, 39, 399], [6, 77, 123, 125, 7, 509, 264, 2324, 999, 4, 0, 3782, 3627, 3, 0, 1115, 15820, 618, 2527, 234, 5, 3631, 3, 7, 1459, 5, 802, 12, 1269, 25, 37, 5754, 1442, 10, 130, 3627, 385, 0, 179], [37, 30, 52, 0, 3287, 6, 0, 2046, 5, 644, 1573], [6, 0, 104, 112, 63, 33, 30, 109, 905, 608, 2536, 12, 30, 3472, 1459, 21021, 8077, 802, 128, 1442, 10, 873, 0, 1459, 14219, 42, 20, 30, 332, 18368, 4, 88]], [[871, 73, 886, 8077, 10, 37, 747, 30, 190, 60, 21, 0, 198, 1286, 46, 30, 60951, 19186, 48, 495, 22, 7, 79, 4, 128, 1957, 3035, 109, 1530, 1296, 968, 1254, 13, 2874, 549, 772, 1530], [37, 30, 0, 395, 8975, 3, 0, 3782, 3627, 1812, 0, 1885, 5, 866, 4, 64, 165, 5273, 36, 120, 12, 4280, 46, 2502], [125, 483, 33, 159, 4011, 2502, 181, 5062, 7, 20, 1566, 8077, 5, 581, 3035]], [[100, 37, 30, 5480, 3982, 3, 7, 4849, 270, 427, 5692]], [[155, 38, 5666, 37, 1769, 30, 1310, 17, 0, 288, 267320, 3, 1459, 55799, 5, 0, 3782, 3627, 3, 0, 1115, 618, 546], [20, 30, 1568, 7, 2941, 24718, 4, 7, 4849, 270, 427, 6512, 3, 6443, 121, 830, 7059, 5, 1459, 1483]]]}]}

Voyageurs, coureurs des bois, and Catholic missionaries used river canoes to explore the interior of the North American continent. \n\nAfter 1627, King Louis XIII of France made a rule that only Roman Catholics could go to live in New France.

These beliefs according to some religious sects, are often linked to supernatural beings such as God, a number of gods or spirits. They may also be linked to an idea such as a path that the spirit of each person should take towards goodness, truth and duty. This they called spirituality. \n\nEach religion has different ideas about these things. Each religion also has a \"moral code\" which is a set of beliefs about how humans should act.

This is called \"witnessing\". \n\nThere are many ways to witness. A young person might simply say to their friends \"I do not use drugs or get drunk because of my religion\". This is a witness. A person may tell their classmates, workmates and friends about their beliefs. A person might go to other people's houses and talk about their beliefs, or invite the people to join in the rituals of the religion, such as going to church or to a religious festival. A person might have printed material such as books or leaflets that they give to other people to read. A person might travel to a different country to teach, to work in a health service or to help people in some other way. (People who do this are called \"missionaries\".) These are different ways that people witness to their religion.\n\nWhen a person hears a witness and decides that they will join the religion, this is called a \"conversion\". Usually a person decides to join a religion because they like what they have read or been told, and they believe that they are hearing the truth. They join the religion because they choose. However, throughout history there have been many times when people have been forced to join a religion by violence and threats.

They developed the best army in the world at that time, and ruled by force. They had fine engineering, and built roads, cities, and outstanding buildings. The Empire was divided into provinces, each with a governor plus civil and military support. Letters, both official and private, would constantly go to and from Rome.\n\nTrade was most important for Rome, a city of more than a million people, by far the largest city in the world. They needed, and got, wheat from Egypt, tin from Britannia, grapes from Gaul, and so on. In return, the Romans built provincial capitals into fine cities, protected them from raids by barbarians, and provided education and career opportunities for young people in the provinces, such as jobs in the Roman Army.\n\nIn principle, emperors had absolute control, and could do as they pleased. In practice, they faced many difficult problems. They had a staff of what we call 'civil servants' and the advice of the Roman Senate. The emperor had to decide what were the most important issues facing the Empire, and what should be done about them. Most of them tried to do two sorts of thing. One was to do things to improve the life of Romans in peacetime. The other was to fight and defeat Rome's enemies. A wealthy empire always has enemies.\n\nWith kings and emperors, a big problem is the order of succession. Kings were sometimes followed by their eldest son, if he was capable of ruling. For Roman emperors, more often it would be an adopted son. It worked like this. The emperor would notice an outstanding young man from one of the best families. He would adopt him as his son. Before he died he would make clear whom he thought should succeed him, by making him a Roman consul, or by stating in his will that the younger man should succeed him. Sometimes this worked; sometimes it did not. Every now and then there would be a civil war between claimants to the throne.\n\nAn adopted son or two gave the emperor more choices. Some emperors had no son; somehad sons who were killed in battle, or died during a plague. Later on, emperors grew so weak that the Roman army would just pick one of their generals to be the next emperor. This often led to civil war. The life stories of the emperors can be found in List of Roman emperors.\n\nThe Romans fought many wars against other countries, and enjoyed watching violent sports. They enjoyed watching races between chariots pulled by horses, and fights between men using weapons (gladiators). Unlike in modern sports, the fighters were often killed in fights. Romans enjoyed these shows in the Colosseum.\n\nThe Romans had great civil engineering. They built many large public buildings and villas, aqueducts to carry water, stone bridges and roads. Some of these things can still be seen today. Many famous writers were Romans, including Cicero and Virgil.\n\nThe New Testament of the Bible tells about the Romans in the life of Jesus Christ. During Jesus' life, the Romans, who were pagans, ruled his country. Later, several emperors tried to destroy Christianity but they did not succeed. By 312  the emperor Galerius allowed people freedom to follow Christianity, and the next year, a general, Constantine, became emperor and converted to Christianity.\n\nThe city of Rome was taken over several times by barbarians, notably in 410  when the Goths sacked the city (looting). The last Western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustus, resigned in 476 . The Roman Empire would last another 1,000 years as the Byzantine Empire in the east.\n\nThe main coin of the Roman Empire was the silver denarius. Later denarii were smaller.\n\nVarious reasons have been given for the fall of Rome. Edward Gibbon wrote a long book called ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' in which he said it was because the Romans didn't care enough to fight hard anymore, Other historians blame the unstable system of leadership. In a 50-year period, only 2 out of 22 emperors died a natural death. Most of the emperors were assassinated.<ref></ref>", "paragraphs": [[[6, 460, 4, 424, 44, 426, 2552, 0, 1956, 281809, 481, 1159, 59, 264, 5, 78], [39, 281809, 0, 143, 330, 6, 0, 85, 22, 12, 79, 5, 1067, 21, 352], [39, 33, 1695, 3939, 5, 1190, 586, 115, 5, 3535, 447], [0, 2552, 30, 6586, 75, 624, 236, 17, 7, 1004, 2258, 786, 5, 178, 280], [2673, 150, 239, 5, 672, 54, 5815, 242, 4, 5, 25, 2618]], [[312, 30, 181, 481, 10, 2618, 7, 115, 3, 181, 73, 7, 93, 69, 21, 372, 0, 426, 115, 6, 0, 85], [39, 408, 5, 169, 5252, 25, 1598, 8453, 25, 27180, 12677, 25, 31018, 5, 100, 13], [6, 498, 0, 1956, 1190, 2483, 351, 75, 1695, 115, 1508, 101, 25, 3333, 21, 30867, 5, 761, 631, 5, 432, 1539, 10, 461, 69, 6, 0, 624, 125, 7, 664, 6, 0, 1956, 330]], [[6, 3847, 3579, 33, 6147, 424, 5, 86, 88, 7, 39, 3832], [6, 1276, 39, 621, 109, 1013, 747], [39, 33, 7, 821, 3, 102, 53, 580, 786, 9848, 5, 0, 3240, 3, 0, 1956, 748], [0, 3579, 33, 4, 2099, 102, 30, 0, 181, 481, 495, 621, 0, 2552, 5, 102, 189, 30, 88, 59, 101], [96, 3, 101, 841, 4, 88, 55, 2598, 3, 873], [48, 30, 4, 88, 873, 4, 1567, 0, 214, 3, 1956, 6, 24627], [0, 68, 30, 4, 838, 5, 1841, 2618, 2928], [7, 4551, 2552, 690, 33, 2928]], [[17, 691, 5, 3579, 7, 365, 747, 30, 0, 460, 3, 6745], [3947, 30, 1071, 1816, 21, 44, 8042, 630, 83, 18, 30, 3428, 3, 1067], [10, 1956, 3579, 181, 456, 20, 54, 30, 7, 5045, 630], [20, 161, 117, 37], [0, 3579, 54, 3995, 7, 3535, 461, 300, 25, 48, 3, 0, 143, 213], [18, 54, 5045, 103, 7, 26, 630], [106, 18, 2357, 18, 54, 159, 706, 1231, 18, 269, 189, 4372, 103, 21, 159, 103, 7, 1956, 12679, 46, 21, 92, 6, 26, 43, 12, 0, 461, 300, 189, 4372, 103], [1071, 37, 161, 1071, 20, 88, 36], [359, 114, 5, 127, 63, 54, 30, 7, 786, 136, 118, 34659, 4, 0, 6752]], [[29, 5045, 630, 46, 55, 455, 0, 3579, 181, 1675], [77, 3579, 33, 84, 630, 630, 38, 30, 1916, 6, 903, 46, 2357, 105, 7, 11075], [168, 13, 3579, 2274, 100, 2690, 12, 0, 1956, 330, 54, 120, 2065, 48, 3, 44, 216, 4, 30, 0, 182, 3579], [37, 456, 410, 4, 786, 136], [0, 214, 523, 3, 0, 3579, 86, 30, 596, 6, 674, 3, 1956, 3579]], [[0, 1956, 838, 109, 136, 98, 68, 123, 5, 3710, 1716, 2528, 1935], [39, 3710, 1716, 572, 118, 29184, 2933, 21, 2867, 5, 838, 118, 300, 234, 4034, 27782], [2633, 6, 1194, 1935, 0, 3510, 30, 456, 1916, 6, 838], [1956, 3710, 37, 273, 6, 0, 38884]], [[0, 1956, 33, 353, 786, 3939], [39, 1190, 109, 426, 198, 447, 5, 4964, 24417, 4, 1619, 430, 2155, 1641, 5, 586], [77, 3, 37, 873, 86, 149, 30, 253, 373], [109, 1613, 1541, 30, 1956, 488, 27295, 5, 24083]], [[0, 50, 9068, 3, 0, 5489, 1361, 59, 0, 1956, 6, 0, 214, 3, 3993, 4904], [105, 3993, 214, 0, 1956, 38, 30, 16940, 1067, 26, 123], [168, 201, 3579, 841, 4, 4526, 7282, 34, 39, 88, 36, 4372], [21, 0, 3579, 117619, 949, 69, 1637, 4, 1816, 7282, 5, 0, 182, 62, 7, 216, 14935, 399, 3579, 5, 7037, 4, 7282]], [[0, 115, 3, 2618, 30, 190, 74, 201, 79, 21, 30867, 3722, 6, 61, 0, 47479, 11739, 0, 115, 24772], [0, 76, 556, 1956, 3579, 46846, 15751, 4578, 6], [0, 1956, 2552, 54, 76, 170, 62, 7, 0, 10617, 2552, 6, 0, 322]], [[0, 444, 9569, 3, 0, 1956, 2552, 30, 0, 1891, 154437], [168, 154437, 30, 357]], [[917, 1247, 33, 30, 455, 10, 0, 807, 3, 2618], [2701, 44332, 2432, 7, 173, 539, 580, 0, 1943, 5, 807, 3, 0, 1956, 2552, 6, 42, 18, 203, 20, 30, 113, 0, 1956, 88, 757, 575, 4, 838, 605, 5717, 68, 5063, 3636, 0, 11178, 278, 3, 1356], [6, 7, 566, 91, 66, 3, 3579, 2357, 7, 1132, 336], [96, 3, 0, 3579, 30]]]}, {"title": "References", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}, {"title": "Other websites", "text": "* An old map of the Roman Empire in 400 AD\n* BBC, Romans for Children, website on ancient Rome for children at the level of primary school\n* Rome Unleashed, interactive educational website on ancient Rome for students", "paragraphs": [[[], [29, 167, 3464, 3, 0, 1956, 2552, 6, 2956, 3092, 1956, 10, 271, 2557, 13, 2359, 2618, 10, 964, 22, 0, 505, 3, 1417, 164], [2618, 11621, 7100, 3405, 2557, 13, 2359, 2618, 10, 1283]]]}]}
{"title": "Regime", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "A '''regime''' is the leader and other people who run a government of a sovereign state.\n\nThere are many kinds of regimes.  They can achieve power in many ways.  Depending on the time and place and local civics like the electoral system, they can lose power in many ways too.  The most common way for a regime to lose power was a coup, invasion or revolution until the 20th century.  After that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods.  Peaceful regime change is usually by an election - this method is now used by more than half the people on the Earth.  It is called representative democracy.  Such regimes are often called '''administration'''s to make it clear they are not dictators, and since the executive branch does not have all the power itself - it may share it with a legislative branch.  Also the judicial branch is separate.  The courts are not usually considered part of the regime.\n\nHowever, some things are the same no matter how the regime achieved power:\n\n*The regime needs help among people outside the regime and government to stay in power - these may be in the military or a political party.\n*Military and police obey the regime's orders, and can kill people.

The place where the river flows out into a bigger body of water is called the 'mouth' of the river. \n\nAs a river flows towards its mouth, the countryside around the river often changes from hilly to flat. As it flows over the flat land the river becomes wider and slower. A wide slow river is called an 'old river'. An old river often floods across the land after there is lots of rain at the headwaters. An old river slowly builds up its banks on either side; the high banks are called levees. An old river often meanders (twists and turns), and sometimes, after a flood, it leaves lakes behind which are called ox-bows or billabongs. Old rivers are the most useful type of river for growing crops. Corn, rice, fruit, cotton, hay, tobacco and sugar are some of the crops that are grown near old rivers. \n\nThe shape of the mouth depends on the conditions of the sea where it flows. If there is a strong tide where the river meets the sea, the river forms an estuary.  An estuary is a wide, funnel-like mouth of the river.  The fresh water of the river mixes slowly with the salt water, becoming brackish water \u2013 somewhat salty water. Many kinds of fish, clams, molluscs and other sealife live at estuaries. Many of the world's largest cities and harbours are at estuaries.\n\nWhere a river flows out to the sea, it sometimes flows very slowly through sandy or muddy land, making lots of little islands as it flows. The main stream of the river gets broken into many parts that spread out into a triangle shape like the Greek letter delta. When this happens, it is called the delta of the river. Deltas are often places that are not good for towns or farms but are very good for birds and other wildlife and fishing. Deltas are often made into wildlife reserves.  Not all rivers have deltas.  There are famous deltas on the Nile River, the Amazon River, the Mekong River, the Mississippi River and the Danube River. \n\n<gallery> \nImage:Nowitna river.jpg|The Nowitna is an old river with meanders and ox-bow lakes. \nImage:Gangesdelta klein.jpg|The delta of the Ganges River in India\nImage:Aerial view of Okavango.jpg|The grassy islands of the Okavango delta are the home of elephants, lions and flamingos.\nImage:LOC Brooklyn Bridge and East River 2 cropped.jpg|Cities are often near the mouth of a river. \n</gallery>", "paragraphs": [[[7, 620, 1140, 156, 21, 2981, 75, 7, 2561, 7, 1241, 46, 7, 365, 620], [0, 241, 111, 0, 620, 2981, 66, 75, 7, 365, 719, 3, 430, 30, 580, 0, 4166, 3, 0, 620]], [[19, 7, 620, 2981, 1811, 47, 4166, 0, 7812, 204, 0, 620, 456, 511, 25, 18230, 4, 2983], [19, 20, 2981, 74, 0, 2983, 607, 0, 620, 399, 1260, 5, 2049], [7, 1260, 2049, 620, 30, 580, 7, 167, 620], [29, 167, 620, 456, 3708, 531, 0, 607, 49, 63, 30, 530, 3, 2298, 22, 0, 86247], [29, 167, 620, 3892, 1190, 60, 47, 231, 13, 900, 437, 0, 152, 231, 30, 580, 23294], [29, 167, 620, 456, 55061, 8558, 5, 890, 5, 1071, 49, 7, 3708, 20, 891, 1241, 561, 42, 30, 580, 29585, 7331, 46, 374324], [167, 620, 30, 0, 181, 4699, 1554, 3, 620, 10, 2274, 5413], [4719, 1818, 4138, 5223, 10283, 3179, 5, 3191, 30, 77, 3, 0, 5413, 12, 30, 2274, 355, 167, 620]], [[0, 3030, 3, 0, 4166, 5946, 13, 0, 1217, 3, 0, 937, 111, 20, 2981], [83, 63, 30, 7, 562, 7491, 111, 0, 620, 700, 0, 937, 0, 620, 683, 7, 20028], [29, 20028, 30, 7, 1260, 21296, 117, 4166, 3, 0, 620], [0, 1903, 430, 3, 0, 620, 3634, 3892, 17, 0, 2982, 430, 399, 43912, 430, 3779, 23670, 430], [109, 921, 3, 2120, 33065, 55541, 5, 68, 163120, 682, 22, 20028], [109, 3, 0, 85, 426, 115, 5, 8451, 30, 22, 20028]], [[111, 7, 620, 2981, 66, 4, 0, 937, 20, 1071, 2981, 191, 3892, 131, 7513, 46, 14421, 607, 159, 530, 3, 333, 583, 7, 20, 2981], [0, 444, 5220, 3, 0, 620, 169, 1129, 75, 109, 153, 12, 1635, 66, 75, 7, 9464, 3030, 117, 0, 1622, 1258, 3621], [61, 37, 1927, 20, 30, 580, 0, 3621, 3, 0, 620], [72290, 30, 456, 241, 12, 30, 36, 219, 10, 328, 46, 1988, 34, 30, 191, 219, 10, 2632, 5, 68, 4446, 5, 2120], [72290, 30, 456, 159, 75, 4446, 1618], [36, 64, 620, 33, 3621], [63, 30, 1613, 3621, 13, 0, 11003, 620, 0, 8427, 620, 0, 19515, 620, 0, 4049, 620, 5, 0, 15590, 620]], [[3911], [1959], [], [30, 7, 167, 620, 17, 55061, 5, 29585, 7331, 1241], [1959], [3621, 3, 0, 28367, 620, 6, 474, 1959], [8200, 1139, 3, 22037, 583, 3, 0, 117150, 3621, 30, 0, 163, 3, 9323, 6657, 5, 35115], [1959], [30759, 4430, 1641, 5, 322, 620, 30, 456, 355, 0, 4166, 3, 7, 620], [], [], []]]}, {"title": "Underground rivers", "text": "Some rivers flow underground through caves.

The first view is connected with an ontological understanding of substance as ultimate bases being (Francis Bacon, Benedict Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz). Central category of metaphysics in philosophy substance is identified as with God and with nature and determined as the cause of itself (Latin causa sui). The main characteristics (attributes) of a substance from Benedict Spinoza are thinking and stretch. By analogy with the philosophy of Benedict Spinoza substance considered in the light of the concept of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Leibniz. The first substance is a unity of subject and object, and the second - the same atoms are simple beings who lose their stretch, but receive attribute aspirations (Fr. appetition) and multiplicity. Thanks Leibniz substance begins to associate with matter.\n\nThe second point of view on the substance - an epistemological understanding of the concept, its capabilities and the need for scientific knowledge (John Locke, David Hume).

When theories no longer explain the data, they are discarded and replaced. Or, sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than discard it, or they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually.\n  \nScience is a way to get knowledge by discarding what is not true. \n \nScientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they observe and measure.  They compete to provide better explanations.  An explanation might be interesting or pleasing, but if it does not agree with what other scientists really see and measure, they will try to find a better explanation.\n\nBefore a scientific article is published, other scientists read the article and decide whether the explanations make sense from the data.  This is called peer review.  After articles are published, other scientists will also check if the same experiments, observations or tests produce the same data again.

Over time, slang almost always becomes part of the language, and approved for use by all.\n\nIt has also happened that some words used in Anglo-Saxon for bodily functions became thought of as profanity or rude after they were replaced by Latinate words like \"urinate\", \"defecate\" and \"copulate\" - which polite people were supposed to use after the Norman conquest of England in 1066.  This was in part a way of making poor people (who spoke Anglo-Saxon) all appear to be rude, while more powerful people (who spoke Norman) appeared to be polite - one way that etiquette can develop, and reinforce power structure.  This is only one example from history of how racism can be a reason for defining one group's language as 'slang' and another as 'correct'.\n\nWanting to have rules of grammar that do not change and the same vocabulary used by everyone for better communication is another reason that is often given for defining one group's language as correct.\n\nAn \"idiom\" can be slang, but it can also be a metaphor that becomes part of the culture.\n\nTwo examples of slang are 'wassup' and 'dunnow'.

It is a reproductive structure which disperses,<ref>spreads away from the parent plant</ref> and can survive for some time. A typical seed includes three basic parts: (1) an embryo, (2) a supply of nutrients for the embryo, and (3) a seed coat.\n\nThere are many different kinds of seeds. Some plants make a lot of seeds, some make only a few. Seeds are often hard and very small, but some are larger. The coconut is as big as a child's head, but it contains more than just a seed. At the start, seeds are ''dormant'' (resting inside their coat) for a while. When the seed is ready to develop, it needs water, air and warmth ''but not sunlight'' to become a seedling.\n\nSeeds carry the food that helps the new plant begin to grow.

Details of the triggers are known for some, but not all, seeds. Rain, fire, ground temperature, are examples. Many seeds only germinate after they have been eaten and passed through the digestive system of an animal. This also is a dispersal method.\n\nWhen a seed germinates (\"wakes up\"), it begins to grow into a little plant called a ''seedling''.<ref name=\"Baskin, C.C 1998\"/> It uses the soft fleshy material inside the seed for nutrients (food) until it is ready to make food on its own using sunlight, water and air.\n\nMost seeds germinate underground where there is no sunlight. The plant does not need the nutrients in soil for a few days or weeks, because the seed has all the things it needs to grow.<ref name=Fenner/> Later, though, it will begin to need sunlight. If there is sunlight, the plant will use it to grow healthy. If there is no light, the plant will still grow for a while, but its plastids will not mature: the chlorophyll does not turn green. If the plant does not get enough light, it will eventually die.

Spores have little food stored, and may be just single cells rather than embryos.\n\nThe evolution of seeds changed the plant life cycle by freeing plants from the need for external water for sexual reproduction, and by providing protection and nutrients for the developing embryo.

They say that there is an analogy between the obligation of the Christian day of worship and the Sabbath-day ordinance. These two rules are not literally identical though. They say that this ordinance is no longer valid, because God has replaced his old creation by a new one.<ref></ref> For this reason, the obligation to keep the Sabbath is not the same for Christians as for Jews. They say there are examples in the New Testament, and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries.\n\nSome conservative Christians are \"Sabbatarians\". Most of these follow the Reformed traditions. Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or ''Lord's Day'' is the new Sabbath. This is because the 4th commandment has never been revoked and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation ordinance.\n\nStill others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on the Saturday, reserving Sunday as a day of worship. In reference to Acts 20:7, the disciples came together on the first day of the week (Sunday) to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul. This is not the first time Christians assembled together on a Sunday; Jesus appeared to the Christians on the \"first day of the week\" while they were in hiding. One can maintain this argument in that Jesus himself maintained the Sabbath, although not within the restrictions that were mandated by Jewish traditions;  the Pharisees often tried Jesus by asking him if certain tasks were acceptable according to the Law.<ref></ref> This would seem to show that while the Sabbath was still of importance to the Jews, Sunday was a separate day for worship and teaching from Scriptures.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventists and other churches disagree with some of these views. They argue that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in paganism, specifically Sol Invictus and Mithraism (in which sun god worship took place on Sunday). This is therefore an explicit rejection of the commandment to keep the ''seventh'' day holy. Instead, they keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God's work of creation<ref>, , </ref> believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed.<ref>, </ref> Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the 2nd and 3rd century, by most until the 4th and 5th century, and a few thereafter, but because of opposition to Judaism after the Jewish-Roman wars, the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship. The history of these changes is certainly not altogether lost regardless of any belief in a suppression of the facts by a conspiracy of the pagans of the Roman Empire and the clergy of the Catholic Church.\n\nJews had come to be hated in the Roman Empire after the Jewish-Roman wars. This led to the criminalization of the Jewish Sabbath. Hatred of Jews is apparent in the Council of Laodicea (4th Century AD) where Canon 37\u201338 states: \"It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them.\" and \"It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety.\"  In keeping with this rejection of the Jews, this Roman council also criminalized the Jewish Sabbath as can be seen in Canon 29 of the Council Laodicea: \"Christians must not Judaize by resting on the Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honoring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians. But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be excommunicated from Christ.\"<ref></ref>\n\nIn the Gospel of Mark 2:28 Jesus says 'the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath'.", "paragraphs": [[[96, 1377, 2384, 0, 16887, 13, 240, 4, 2715, 0, 16493, 3, 3993, 13, 0, 122, 3, 0, 147, 13, 0, 1316, 5657], [39, 203, 12, 63, 30, 7, 20569, 118, 0, 7726, 3, 0, 1377, 122, 3, 7071, 5, 0, 16887, 122, 13251], [158, 55, 1067, 30, 36, 5917, 6684, 413], [39, 203, 12, 37, 13251, 30, 84, 173, 7043, 113, 1533, 33, 2451, 26, 167, 2675, 21, 7, 50], [10, 37, 1247, 0, 7726, 4, 578, 0, 16887, 30, 36, 0, 215, 10, 1377, 7, 10, 12471], [39, 203, 63, 30, 880, 6, 0, 50, 9068, 5, 6, 68, 1649, 3981, 25, 0, 306, 589]], [[77, 1460, 1377, 30, 362784], [96, 3, 37, 1816, 0, 9746, 2836], [362784, 269, 0, 122, 3, 0, 147, 46, 2370, 122, 30, 0, 50, 16887], [37, 30, 113, 0, 41938, 33, 332, 30, 20045, 5, 16887, 578, 30, 6, 130, 305, 7, 2675, 13251]], [[149, 68, 733, 12, 0, 16887, 944, 7, 7, 122, 3, 1033, 13, 0, 277, 1618, 240, 7, 7, 122, 3, 7071], [6, 2978, 4, 2537, 0, 21379, 326, 600, 13, 0, 122, 3, 0, 147, 240, 4, 1129, 5872, 5, 4, 2271, 0, 19914, 3, 0, 23495, 923], [37, 30, 36, 0, 79, 1377, 13504, 600, 13, 7, 240, 3993, 1650, 4, 0, 1377, 13, 0, 122, 3, 0, 147, 110, 39, 30, 6, 5708], [48, 86, 2188, 37, 4019, 6, 12, 3993, 670, 2188, 0, 16887, 376, 36, 425, 0, 13176, 12, 30, 4401, 21, 1316, 2836, 0, 174730, 456, 841, 3993, 21, 1712, 103, 83, 1192, 2170, 30, 6330, 2733, 4, 0, 37, 54, 1914, 4, 273, 12, 110, 0, 16887, 30, 149, 3, 2604, 4, 0, 12471, 240, 30, 7, 1350, 122, 10, 7071, 5, 5293, 25, 23898]], [[0, 2420, 122, 57321, 5, 68, 512, 10027, 17, 77, 3, 37, 1139], [39, 4117, 12, 0, 7439, 3, 700, 10, 7071, 13, 240, 21211, 6, 48741, 3565, 14534, 77508, 5, 217250, 6, 42, 1662, 1533, 7071, 190, 241, 13, 240], [37, 30, 2317, 7, 9921, 7722, 3, 0, 41938, 4, 578, 0, 632, 122, 2677], [773, 39, 578, 277, 7, 0, 16887, 7, 7, 2520, 4, 1533, 161, 3, 2675, 29126], [], [733, 12, 2125, 3, 0, 1705, 20966, 86, 661, 30], [2420, 122, 362784, 1547, 12, 0, 632, 122, 16887, 30, 578, 21, 0, 902, 3, 1377, 129, 207, 0, 5, 589, 21, 181, 207, 0, 5, 589, 5, 7, 306, 6901, 34, 113, 3, 577, 4, 11480, 49, 0, 1316, 1956, 136, 0, 929, 7439, 30, 4442, 2451, 21, 240, 7, 0, 122, 3, 7071], [0, 299, 3, 37, 511, 30, 2032, 36, 7503, 1895, 5213, 3, 130, 4440, 6, 7, 13858, 3, 0, 853, 21, 7, 4642, 3, 0, 16940, 3, 0, 1956, 2552, 5, 0, 8754, 3, 0, 1538, 512]], [[12471, 33, 326, 4, 30, 5281, 6, 0, 1956, 2552, 49, 0, 1316, 1956, 136], [37, 410, 4, 0, 81818, 3, 0, 1316, 16887], [8936, 3, 12471, 30, 3456, 6, 0, 382, 3, 142605, 589, 2956, 111, 9579, 92], [20, 30, 36, 19296, 4, 1653, 2939, 1545, 25, 0, 10058, 3, 12471, 46, 51938, 2094, 4, 10058, 600, 17, 101], [], [5, 20, 30, 36, 19296, 4, 1653, 92634, 5872, 25, 0, 12471, 2094, 4, 30, 3, 44, 167705], [6, 578, 17, 37, 7722, 3, 0, 12471, 37, 1956, 382, 52, 48345, 0, 1316, 16887, 7, 86, 30, 253, 6, 9579, 3, 0, 382, 142605], [1377, 390, 36, 158862, 21, 1033, 13, 0, 16887, 34, 390, 161, 13, 12, 122, 871, 2384, 0, 2370, 122, 5, 83, 39, 86, 1033, 127, 7, 1377], [34, 83, 130, 5284, 30, 596, 4, 30, 316306, 886, 101, 30, 107607, 25]], [[6, 0, 7758, 3, 799], [3993, 203, 0, 630, 3, 300, 30, 2370, 151, 3, 0, 16887]]]}, {"title": "References", "text": "", "paragraphs": [[]]}]}

Usually a server will only do a few things for many clients. Every type of thing a server does is called a service. Services are used by other computers that are called clients. The relationship between client and server is called a client-server relationship. For example, Wikipedia has web servers which have a service for sending web pages over the Internet. Your client computer talks to Wikipedia's web page service to get web pages for you. A server can also host internet games, share files, and give access to peripheral equipment such as printers. In simple words, the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers. These store files and information in the form of website. With an Internet connection, different users anywhere in the world can access these files.\n\nSo that servers and clients can talk to each other, they need to be connected to a network, and they need to use the same protocol. In networks, a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines. It is just like a language. For example, the Wikipedia server runs the HTTP to send web sites to your computer, and your computer uses the HTTP Protocol to ask Wikipedia for pages.\n\nUsually, servers are specially made to be more powerful and reliable, and they are much more expensive than normal computers. Sometimes, servers can be clustered, which means that lots of servers work together to do one service.\n\nThe server might slow down if there are too many people accessing the server at the same time, resulting in a high load. It might also be unable to take the high load, so it will automatically shut down.\n\nIn a peer-to-peer system, every computer is both a client and a server to the others. This is commonly put into file sharing and VOIP.  However, this can help in attempts at piracy.\n\nTypical server operating systems are Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. Unlike other computers, a server often has no monitor, keyboard, or mouse.

{"title": "Stream", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "A '''stream''' is a natural flow of water moving across country between banks. It is smaller than a river.\n\nThe primary meaning of '''stream''' is a body of water, confined within a bed and banks, and having a detectable current.  Synonyms or related words include river, creek, tributary, run, branch, brook, bourne, wash, and fork. Navigable streams are sometimes called waterways, though the term may apply to any size of permanent and natural water feature except oceans.\n\nIn the United States, an intermittent stream is one that only flows for part of the year and is marked on topographic maps with a line of blue dashes and dots.  In desert areas of the American Southwest, this also includes washes, which only flow after thunderstorms or other significant rains.  A blue-line stream is one which flows for most or all of the year and is marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line. In Australia, an intermittent stream is usually called a creek, and marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line.\n\nGenerally, streams that form only during and immediately after precipitation are termed ephemeral streams.\n\nStreams in geographic terms are awarded order designations.  A stream of the first order is a blue-line stream which does not have any other blue-line stream feeding into it.  A stream of the second order is one which is formed by the joining of two or more blue-line streams.  A third-order stream is one below the confluence of two or more second-order streams; a fourth-order stream is formed by the confluence of at least two third-order streams, and so forth.\n\nTypically, streams are said to have a particular profile, beginning with steep gradients, no flood plain, and little shifting of channels, eventually evolving into streams with low gradients, wide flood plains, and extensive meanders.  The initial stage is sometimes termed a \"young\" stream, and the later state a \"mature\" or \"old\" stream.  However, a stream may meander for some distance before falling into a \"young\" stream condition.\n\nThe gradient of a stream is a critical factor in determining its character, and is entirely determined by its base level of erosion.  The base level of erosion is the point at which the stream either enters the ocean, a lake or pond, or enters a stretch in which it has a much lower gradient, and may be specifically applied to any particular stretch of a stream.  In geologic terms, the stream will erode down through its bed to achieve the base level of erosion throughout its course.  If this base level is low, then the stream will rapidly cut through underlying strata and have a steep gradient, and if the base level is relatively high, then the stream will form a flood plain and meanders.\n\nWhen a stream flows over an especially resistant stratum and forms a waterfall or cascade, or the same results because for some reason the base level of erosion suddenly drops, perhaps as a result of a fault, the resulting sudden change in stream elevation is called a nickpoint.  The stream, of course, expends kinetic energy in \"trying\" to eliminate the nickpoint.\n\nMeanders are looping changes of direction of a stream.  These may be somewhat sine-wave in form.  Typically, over time, the meanders don't disappear but gradually migrate downstream.  However, if some resistant material slows or stops the downstream movement of a meander, a stream may erode through the neck between two legs of a meander to become temporarily straighter, leaving behind an arc-shaped body of water termed an oxbow lake or bayou.  A flood may also result in a meander being cut through in this way.\n\nThe point of origin of a stream is often called the headwaters or source.  The entire basin drained by the stream is termed the watershed.  Every watershed is made up of smaller watersheds, while most watersheds are parts of larger watersheds.  For instance, the Continental Divide in North America divides the Atlantic Ocean watershed from the Pacific Ocean watershed, but the Atlantic Ocean watershed may be first divided into the Atlantic Ocean drainage and the Gulf of Mexico drainage.  This delineation within the United States is termed the Eastern Divide.  The Gulf of Mexico watershed may be divided into Mississippi River basin and a number of smaller watersheds, such as the Tombigbee River watershed.\n\nThe Mississippi River watershed includes the Ohio River watershed, which in turn includes the Kentucky River watershed, and so forth.\n\nThe point at which a stream empties into an ocean or other large body of relatively level water is termed the mouth.

They are mostly made of rock and metal, and they are mostly solid.  The last four planets are called gas giants.  This is because they are much larger than other planets and are mostly made of gas.\n\nThe Solar System also contains other things. There are asteroids, mostly between Mars and Jupiter.

These photos were able to show the surface features of the moons. Voyager 1 went close to Titan, and gained much information about its atmosphere. In August, 1981, Voyager 2 continued to study the planet. Photos taken by the space probe showed that changes were happening to the rings and atmosphere. The Voyager spacecrafts discovered a number of moons orbiting close to Saturn's rings, as well as discovering new ring gaps.\n\n\n\nOn July 1, 2004, the Cassini\u2212Huygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn. Before then, it flew close to Phoebe, taking very high resolution photos of its surface and collecting data. On December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini probe before moving down towards Titan's surface and landed there on January 14, 2005. It landed on a dry surface, but it found that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon. The Cassini probe continued to collect data from Titan and a number of the icy moons.

Their living conditions were brutal, and their lives short.\n\nSlaves were considered property under Roman law and had no legal personhood. Unlike Roman citizens, they could be subjected to corporal punishment, sexual exploitation (prostitutes were often slaves), torture, and summary execution. The testimony of a slave could not be accepted in a court of law unless the slave was tortured\u2014a practice based on the belief that slaves in a position to be privy to their masters' affairs would be too virtuously loyal to reveal damaging evidence unless coerced.

The word \"synagogue\" comes from ''sunagoge'', which is a Greek word. In a synagogue, Jews carry out the Jewish services, which consist of prayers, sometimes with special actions.\n\nA synagogue will usually have a large room for prayers. There might be some smaller rooms for studying. There will be some offices. There will also usually be a big room for special events. \n\nThe front of a synagogue faces towards Jerusalem in Israel.  In the front is the holiest part of the synagogue, the Ark. This is a closet which has the Torah scrolls inside.  The Torah scrolls have the holy writings of Judaism on them.  The Ark usually has a curtain in front of it.\n\nOn top of the Ark is light which is always lit, called the \u201cEternal Lamp\u201d. It is a symbol which means that God is always there.\nEvery synagogue has a raised platform called the \u201cBimah\u201d. The person who reads the Torah scroll stands there when he reads. The Bimah is either in the middle of the hall, or in front of the Ark.\n\nIn some synagogues men and women sit in different places. Some synagogues even have a short wall so that they can not see each other. This is so that the people will think about the prayers better.\n\nJews may call synagogues by different names. Many Orthodox and Conservative Jews living in English-speaking countries use the name \"synagogue\" or the word \"shul\", which is Yiddish. Jews who speak Spanish or Portuguese call synagogues ''esnoga''. Some Jews call the synagogue a temple. \n\nJewish worship does not have to be carried out in a synagogue.  It can be wherever a minyan of ten Jews are. It could be in someone's home or anywhere such as a cruise liner or an airplane. Some synagogues have a separate room or torah study, this is called the \"beth midrash\" meaning house of study. Some kinds of Jewish worship can be done alone or with fewer than ten people.\nSynagogues are places were Jews can worship.\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- interwiki -->", "paragraphs": [[[7, 10138, 30, 7, 241, 111, 12471, 700, 4, 7071, 5, 8310, 4, 1533]], [[6, 7585, 7, 10138, 30, 580, 12231, 14156, 42, 1702, 7, 166, 3, 5703], [0, 1388, 10138, 326, 25, 42, 30, 7, 1622, 1388], [6, 7, 10138, 12471, 1619, 66, 0, 1316, 270, 42, 9243, 3, 5073, 1071, 17, 557, 608]], [[7, 10138, 43, 1140, 33, 7, 426, 927, 10, 5073], [63, 107, 30, 77, 357, 927, 10, 806], [63, 43, 30, 77, 283], [63, 43, 52, 1140, 30, 7, 365, 927, 10, 557, 770]], [[0, 669, 3, 7, 10138, 621, 1811, 2013, 6, 315], [6, 0, 669, 30, 0, 2677, 153, 3, 0, 10138, 0], [37, 30, 7, 12876, 42, 33, 0, 16848, 22160, 1038], [0, 16848, 22160, 33, 0, 2677, 1649, 3, 11480, 13, 101], [0, 15950, 1140, 33, 7, 11084, 6, 669, 3, 20]], [[13, 220, 3, 0, 15950, 30, 897, 42, 30, 690, 897, 580, 0, 11822, 15880], [20, 30, 7, 4380, 42, 1702, 12, 1533, 30, 690, 63], [359, 10138, 33, 7, 1474, 3061, 580, 0, 200583], [0, 899, 38, 1465, 0, 16848, 22160, 1346, 63, 61, 18, 1465], [0, 200583, 30, 900, 6, 0, 699, 3, 0, 1053, 46, 6, 669, 3, 0]], [[6, 77, 10138, 300, 5, 787, 3162, 6, 494, 241], [77, 10138, 151, 33, 7, 636, 1015, 100, 12, 39, 86, 36, 253, 236, 68], [37, 30, 100, 12, 0, 69, 43, 269, 59, 0, 5073, 143]], [[12471, 107, 580, 10138, 21, 494, 311], [109, 4219, 5, 1460, 12471, 682, 6, 711, 2199, 123, 234, 0, 311, 10138, 46, 0, 1388, 119292, 42, 30, 20787], [12471, 38, 2199, 1141, 46, 3578, 580, 10138], [77, 12471, 580, 0, 10138, 7, 2610]], [[1316, 7071, 14219, 36, 33, 4, 30, 1619, 66, 6, 7, 10138], [20, 86, 30, 9419, 7, 102212, 3, 1705, 12471, 30], [20, 86, 30, 6, 1318, 163, 46, 4587, 125, 7, 7, 4567, 11479, 46, 7, 7350], [77, 10138, 33, 7, 1350, 927, 46, 16848, 806, 37, 30, 580, 0, 10265, 49893, 1702, 166, 3, 806], [77, 921, 3, 1316, 7071, 86, 30, 88, 1485, 46, 17, 306, 73, 1705, 69], [19840, 30, 241, 30, 12471, 86, 7071]], [], [], [[], []]]}]}

There were contests among the playwrights (people who write plays are called playwrights) and the winner would get a prize.\n\nThe Greeks had many brilliant ideas. They used mechanical devices like trap door<nowiki/>s and the ''machina'': a crane for winching gods on and off the stage (hence 'Deus ex machina'). They had a ''Greek chorus'' that offered information to help the audience follow the performance. The chorus comments on themes, and shows how an audience might react to the drama. The players wore masks. Illustrations on vases show helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth, plus a wig.

There are a variety of interpretations of these commandments:\n;Images\n\nOne understanding on the commandment to not make \"any image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above\" is as from Roman Catholicism: they hold that \"likenesses\" may be built and used, as long as the object is not worshipped. The Eastern Orthodox Church has a very similar position. Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that the incarnation of an invisible God as a visible human, Jesus, makes it alright to worship images (see Iconoclasm). But, for Jews, Muslims, and most other Christians that violates the commandment.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses criticize the use of all of the above, as well as the use of the cross. The Amish forbid any sort of image, such as photos.\n\n;Sabbath day\n\n\nJews honor the Sabbath ''(Shabbat)'' from sundown on Friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night, the seventh day of the week on the Jewish calendar.\n\nMost Christians honor the Sabbath on Sunday to remember the Resurrection of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar.\n\nSome conservative Christians are \"Sabbatarians\" (most of these follow the Reformed traditions). Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or ''Lord's Day'' is the new Sabbath, because the 4th commandment has never been revoked and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation ordinance.\n\nOthers believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on Saturday, while Sunday as a day of worship, in reference to Acts 20:7: the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul. Also, Jesus appeared to his followers on the \"first day of the week\" while they were in hiding.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church, and some others, believe that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in paganism, specifically Sol Invictus and Mithraism (in which sun god worship took place on Sunday). Instead, Adventists keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God's work of creation<ref>, , </ref> believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed.<ref>, </ref> Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the 2nd and 3rd century, but because of opposition to Judaism after the Jewish-Roman wars, the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship.\n\n;Married relations\n\nTo \"be false to the married relation\", called adultery, is when a married person has sexual relations with a person other than his or her spouse. Having sex without marriage is fornication and is a sin, King James Bible the original unchanged English version.  He taught his audience that the outward act of adultery does not happen apart from sins of the heart: \"From within people, from their hearts, come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly. All these evils come from within and they defile.\u201d<ref>Mark 7:21-23 (NAB), see also Matthew 15:19-20</ref> In The New Testament Jesus says \"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\"<ref>Matthew 5:28</ref>\n\n;Killing or murder\n\nThere are different translations of this commandment; the Hebrew words  are translated either as \"thou shal not kill\" or \"thou shalt not murder\". Older Protestant translations of the Bible, those based on the Vulgate and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it \"Thou shalt not kill\".  The Catholic Church believes that endangerment of human life or safety (e.g., by drunkenness, a love of speed on the road, at sea, or in the air, or gross negligence) is a mortal sin that breaks The Fifth Commandment.  This includes things such as all air forces in the world, use of atomic weapons or drone warfare.  Furthermore, the Catholic Church does not believe in a difference between murder and manslaughter the way the law does.  With the exceptions of killing in self-defense (a form of manslaughter in many nations' laws) and killing in war (but not with air force, atomic weapons or drone warfare), the Catholic Church believes all other forms of killing or attempting to kill violate The Fifth Commandment.  Another example of violating The Fifth Commandment would be driving on an interstate highway or autobahn.  Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use \"You shall not murder\". There are different opinions as to which translation is more faithful to the original.\n\nThe many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God, are quoted in defense of the view that \"murder\" is more accurate.  Furthermore, the Hebrew word for \"kill\" is \"\" - \"''harog''\", while the Hebrew word for \"murder\" is \"\" - \"''retzach''\", which is found in the Ten Commandments \"\" - \"''lo tirtzach''\".\n\n;Stealing\n\nMany theologians (such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt: ''Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog'' (1953)) suggest that commandment \"you shall not steal\" was originally intended against stealing people\u2014abductions and slavery. This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as \"you shall not kidnap\" (e.g. as stated by Rashi).  It has also been pointed out time and again that people such as horse thieves or buffalo hunters on the Great Plains of North America were both stealing and, therefore, breaking this Commandment.

The four main parts of a tree are the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves.\n\nThe roots of a tree are usually under the ground. However, this is not always true. The roots of the mangrove tree are often under water or on the sides of cliffs.<ref name=\"nat\"></ref> A single tree has many roots. The roots carry nutrients and water from the ground through the trunk and branches to the leaves of the tree. They can also breathe in air.<ref name=\"nat\" /> Sometimes, roots are specialized into aerial roots, which can also provide support, as is the case with the banyan tree.\n\nThe trunk is the main body of the tree.

These can be seen if the tree is cut down or in cores taken from the edge to the center of the tree. Correct determination is only possible for trees which make growth rings, generally those which occur in seasonal climates. Trees in uniform non-seasonal tropical climates are always growing and do not have distinct growth rings. It is also only possible for trees which are solid to the center of the tree; many very old trees become hollow as the dead heartwood decays away. For some of these species, age estimates have been made on the basis of extrapolating current growth rates, but the results are usually little better than guesses or speculation.

''Integrated pest management tactics''. Continuing Education Unit, ''International Arboricultural Society'' '''17'''.</ref>\n\nAbiotic sources include lightning, vehicles impacts, and construction activities. Construction activities can involve a number of damage sources, including grade changes that prevent aeration to roots, spills involving toxic chemicals such as cement or petroleum products, or severing of branches or roots. People can damage trees also.\n\nBoth damage sources can result in trees becoming dangerous, and the term \"hazard trees\" is commonly used by arborists, and industry groups such as power line operators. Hazard trees are trees which due to disease or other factors are more susceptible to falling during windstorms, or having parts of the tree fall.\n\nThe process of finding the danger a tree presents is based on a process called the quantified tree risk assessment.<ref>Ellison M.J. 2005  Quantified tree risk assessment used in the management of amenity trees.

Both can take a lot of some types of damage and survive, but even small amounts of certain types of trauma can result in death.

''Journal of Arborculture'' '''8''':169</ref> Even though that is true, most people and construction professionals do not realize how easily a tree can be killed.\n\nOne reason for confusion about tree damage from construction involves the dormancy of trees during winter. Another factor is that trees may not show symptoms of damage until 24 months or longer after damage has occurred. For that reason, persons who do not know about caring for trees may not link the actual cause with the later damaged effect.\n\nVarious organizations have long recognized the importance of construction activities that impact tree health. The impacts are important because they can result in monetary losses due to tree damage and resultant remediation or replacement costs, as well as violation of government ordinances or community or subdivision restrictions.\n\nAs a result, protocols (standard ways) for tree management prior to, during and after construction activities are well established, tested and refined (changed). These basic steps are involved:\n* Review of the construction plans\n* Development of the related tree inventory\n* Application of standard construction tree management protocols\n* Assessment of potential for expected tree damages\n* Development of a tree protection plan (providing for pre-, concurrent, and post construction damage prevention and remediation steps)\n* Development of a tree protection plan\n* Development of a remediation plan\n* Implementation of tree protection zones (TPZs)\n* Assessment of construction tree damage, post-construction\n* Implementation of the remediation plan", "paragraphs": [[[0, 87, 365, 1173, 3, 2654, 1441, 30, 84959, 25, 682, 1173, 114705, 25, 1337, 682, 1173, 5, 20339, 611, 2654, 135], [84959, 1173, 54, 488, 14722, 42, 107, 3045, 75, 0, 2654, 7929, 42, 107, 17734, 14924, 138, 0, 10032, 46, 18636, 42, 107, 14689, 1000, 4, 0], [], [], [33632, 3321, 5434, 19085, 844, 10451], [2265, 631, 1207], [146, 908], []], [[114705, 1173, 488, 6226, 1907, 1433, 5, 916, 1830], [916, 1830, 86, 5273, 7, 30355, 3, 1441, 1173, 488, 2833, 511, 12, 1449, 96956, 4, 5440, 6830, 5273, 6909, 2291, 125, 7, 6529, 46, 4183, 1459, 46, 23320, 3, 2450, 46, 5440], [69, 86, 1441, 2654, 52]], [[150, 1441, 1173, 86, 712, 6, 2654, 399, 2292, 5, 0, 570, 12791, 2654, 30, 3659, 234, 21, 174491, 5, 459, 129, 125, 7, 268, 331, 4545], [12791, 2654, 30, 2654, 42, 445, 4, 1289, 46, 68, 3047, 30, 181, 14185, 4, 807, 105, 72362, 46, 33, 153, 3, 0, 2654, 807]], [[0, 546, 3, 596, 0, 3052, 7, 2654, 943, 30, 815, 13, 7, 546, 580, 0, 29720, 2654, 1118, 15905], [49106, 2654, 1118, 4193, 234, 6, 0, 844, 3, 57205, 2654], [], [146, 908, 3, 222383], [], []], [[2816, 30, 793, 4, 69], [150, 86, 190, 7, 530, 3, 77, 1554, 3, 1441, 5, 3981, 34, 151, 357, 1418, 3, 1192, 1554, 3, 10063, 86, 712, 6, 336], [174491, 30, 191, 3197, 12, 2617, 2654, 43, 36, 10654, 130, 51218, 15387, 3, 0, 5440], [], [4636, 5, 1359, 3, 916, 1441], [], [1473, 3], [], [], [151, 413, 12, 30, 1446, 181, 69, 5, 916, 1162, 88, 36, 4223, 197, 2407, 7, 2654, 86, 30, 1916]], [[48, 1247, 10, 6082, 59, 2654, 1441, 25, 916, 5273, 0, 64945, 3, 2654, 105, 1601], [170, 3047, 30, 12, 2654, 107, 36, 273, 22818, 3, 1441, 207, 229, 46, 173, 49, 1441, 33, 3771], [10, 12, 1247, 899, 38, 88, 36, 346, 59, 757, 10, 2654, 107, 36, 2858, 0, 3570, 1157, 17, 0, 288, 1441, 1261]], [[917, 734, 33, 173, 3807, 0, 2604, 3, 916, 1830, 12, 1433, 2654, 360], [0, 1433, 30, 481, 113, 39, 86, 712, 6, 2974, 866, 445, 4, 2654, 1441, 5, 30021, 37221, 46, 3957, 772, 7, 219, 7, 4653, 3, 78, 13251, 46, 501, 46, 15046, 13176]], [[19, 7, 712, 5667, 1224, 179, 10, 2654, 844, 1996, 4, 105, 5, 49, 916, 1830, 30, 219, 2617, 728, 5, 26346, 511], [158, 2007, 1065, 30, 5273, 1287, 3, 0, 916, 394], [380, 3, 0, 11089, 2654, 7475], [3250, 3, 1224, 916, 2654, 844, 5667], [4193, 3, 1156, 10, 1543, 2654, 1441], [380, 3, 7, 2654, 1464, 394, 761, 10, 20987, 5, 658, 916, 1441, 4636, 5, 37221, 1065], [380, 3, 7, 2654, 1464, 394], [380, 3, 7, 37221, 394], [3982, 3, 2654, 1464, 1498], [4193, 3, 916, 2654, 1441, 658, 916], [3982, 3, 0, 37221, 394]]]}, {"title": "Trees in culture", "text": "The tree has always been a cultural symbol.

{"title": "Taxonomy", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "'''Taxonomy''' is a branch of science. It is about the laws and principles of classifying things.<ref>''Oxford English dictionary''</ref> From one type of taxonomy, many classifications might be produced.\n\nThe best-known kind of taxonomy is used for the classification of lifeforms (living and extinct). Each organism has a scientific name. This name is part of the '''biological classification''' of that species. The name is the same all over the world, so scientists from different places can understand each other. In addition, a species has a position in the tree of life. Thus the crow is ''Corvus corone'', a member of the Corvidae family, and they are passerine birds. That is well agreed, but the classification of some groups is not agreed at present, and often several classifications are being discussed.\n\nLiving things are classified into three domains: bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The highest rank in a domain is the kingdom. Each kingdom has many smaller groups in it, called phyla.<ref>See List of animal phyla</ref> Each phylum has more smaller groups in it, called classes. This pattern looks like branches on a tree with smaller branches growing from them. Each species is put into a group because of what it does, how and what it eats, special body parts, and so on. At the end of the pattern, the groups (genera) are very small. Then each species in the genus is given its own name.\n\nWhen someone writes about a living thing and its formal scientific name, they write the genus and species name. This is known as binomial nomenclature, because it uses two names for each organism. The first is the genus name, and the second is the species in that genus. The scientific name of the domestic cat is ''Felis catus''. Sometimes it is enough to write ''F. catus''.\n\nThese are the major groups (ranks) used in taxonomy:\nKingdom --> Phylum --> Class --> Order --> Family --> Genus --> Species\n\nSome mnemonics (sayings to help a person remember something):\n* King Phillip Came Over From Greater Spain\n\nWhen people started naming species, Latin was a language widely used in Europe. All species names are still written in Latin. This has some advantages. Since Latin is no longer spoken, it is unchanging, and is owned by no-one. It gets over the problem of every language having its own names for animals and plants.\n\nScientists used to write the official description of each new species in Latin.

However, since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on ''cosmological'' length scales, general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate. Nevertheless, its predictions appear to be consistent with observations, so there is no reason to adopt another theory.\n\nGeneral relativity provides of a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric (Einstein's field equations) that must be solved from the distribution of mass-energy and momentum throughout the universe.

In effect, this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density. The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einstein's field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales.\n\nEinstein's field equations include a cosmological constant (Lamda: ''\u039b''),<ref name=\"einstein_1917\">Einstein A.

As noted above, the redshift arises from the metric expansion of space; as the space itself expands, the wavelength of a photon traveling through space likewise increases, decreasing its energy. The longer a photon has been traveling, the more expansion it has undergone; hence, older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red-shifted. Determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental physical cosmology.\n\nOther experimental observations can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear physics and atomic physics. As the universe expands, the energy density of the electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter, since the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. Thus, although the energy density of the universe is now dominated by matter, it was once dominated by radiation; poetically speaking, all was light. As the universe expanded, its energy density decreased and it became cooler; as it did so, the elementary particles of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, in the early part of the matter-dominated era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then associated into atomic nuclei. At this stage, the matter in the universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negative electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. Nuclear reactions among the nuclei led to the present abundances of the lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. Eventually, the electrons and nuclei combined to form stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation; at this point, the radiation decoupled from the matter, forming the ubiquitous, isotropic background of microwave radiation observed today.\n\n\nOther observations are not clearly answered by known physics. According to the prevailing theory, a slight imbalance of matter over antimatter was present in the universe's creation, or developed very shortly thereafter. Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another, producing photons, a small residue of matter survived, giving the present matter-dominated universe.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid cosmic inflation of the universe occurred very early in its history (roughly 10<sup>\u221235</sup> seconds after its creation). Recent observations also suggest that the cosmological constant (''\u039b'') is not zero, and that the net mass-energy content of the universe is dominated by a dark energy and dark matter that have not been characterized scientifically. They differ in their gravitational effects. Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does, and thus slows the expansion of the universe; by contrast, dark energy serves to accelerate the universe's expansion.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 11442, 365, 9200, 1423, 1530, 10, 109, 3, 0, 6122, 7337, 4466, 1069, 125, 7, 0, 18681, 3, 2296, 5, 75639, 3, 8403, 0, 3599, 5380, 3, 9264, 23321, 14367, 5, 0, 15856, 70498, 15181, 6478, 2093], [19, 1812, 1069, 0, 75639, 10852, 25, 0, 8624, 2346, 3, 863, 7, 0, 863, 1003, 2786, 0, 24513, 3, 7, 35117, 1143, 131, 863, 9192, 686, 6748, 47, 634], [0, 173, 7, 35117, 33, 30, 1143, 0, 181, 2346, 20, 33, 7855, 6484, 167, 35117, 25, 181, 6568, 8403, 30, 0, 181, 639, 3251], [8588, 0, 18681, 118, 2296, 5, 75639, 30, 7, 481, 747, 6, 6122, 2183, 33770]], [[68, 6122, 7337, 86, 30, 3392, 21, 6582, 0, 1250, 2346, 3, 863, 17, 490, 106166, 5, 4065, 106166], [19, 0, 5187, 2786, 0, 634, 3846, 3, 0, 19479, 6478, 6748, 181, 1177, 73, 14219, 12, 3, 4041, 108, 0, 634, 3, 7, 35117, 6748, 17, 47, 24513], [1580, 376, 0, 634, 3846, 3, 0, 5187, 30, 114, 7273, 21, 4041, 20, 30, 442, 7273, 21, 6478, 85155, 2199, 64, 30, 897], [19, 0, 5187, 2786, 47, 634, 3846, 6748, 5, 20, 399, 3451, 7, 20, 88, 100, 0, 4808, 12886, 3, 4041, 86, 3891, 121477, 75, 661, 426, 3398], [1580, 6, 0, 199, 153, 3, 0, 4041, 7273, 1592, 3328, 17653, 5, 23783, 683, 42, 127, 3891, 75, 4065, 14605], [22, 37, 912, 0, 4041, 6, 0, 5187, 30, 1674, 7, 1627, 9891, 13493, 3, 2563, 13278, 5876, 43838, 5, 1335, 14605], [490, 2614, 244, 0, 14605, 410, 4, 0, 943, 13668, 3, 0, 897, 14605, 1113, 9264, 67353, 5, 23321], [1181, 0, 13278, 5, 14605, 6582, 4, 683, 3328, 14367, 42, 30, 8858, 4, 181, 24513, 3, 6478, 22, 37, 389, 0, 6478, 135991, 25, 0, 4041, 683, 0, 15856, 70498, 2093, 3, 15181, 6478, 8587, 373]], [[68, 7337, 30, 36, 2056, 2168, 21, 346, 106166], [200, 4, 0, 11442, 2314, 7, 5930, 16244, 3, 4041, 74, 57389, 30, 943, 6, 0, 5187, 2675, 46, 281809, 191, 1860, 6901], [376, 0, 4041, 5, 57389, 1246, 50424, 48, 170, 1711, 35117, 7, 357, 20326, 3, 4041, 3981, 455, 0, 943, 4041, 7273, 5187]], [[201, 331, 3, 906, 52, 3419, 12, 7, 3502, 15438, 1597, 3, 0, 5187, 3771, 191, 199, 6, 47, 299, 3208, 126, 49, 47, 2675], [397, 7337, 52, 3419, 12, 0, 46439, 4190, 34837, 30, 36, 4014, 5, 12, 0, 1050, 1329, 634, 2768, 3, 0, 5187, 30, 7273, 21, 7, 2237, 634, 5, 2237, 4041, 12, 33, 36, 30, 20185, 23086], [39, 9633, 6, 44, 21982, 1261], [2237, 4041, 49034, 7, 4018, 4041, 14219, 5, 1580, 2049, 0, 2346, 3, 0, 5187, 21, 3313, 2237, 634, 1367, 4, 8709, 0, 5187, 2346]]]}, {"title": "Multiverse", "text": "Some people think that there is more than one Universe.

{"title": "Unit of measurement", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "Measurement is a process that uses numbers to describe a physical quantity based on what we can observe. This is done to be able to compare them to each other. We can measure how big things are, how warm they are, how heavy they are, and lots of other features as well.  '''Units of Measurement''' provide standards for our comparisons, so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing.  \n\nFor example, the metre is a standard unit to measure length.  Before 1982, it was defined as the distance between two markers on a special rod.  Now scientists define the metre by using the speed of light. Saying something has a length of 2 metres means that it is exactly twice as long as that rod used to define the metre, or that light takes twice the time defined for a metre to travel that distance.\n\nIn past centuries many different units were used in different countries. Today, most units of measure fall into one of three systems:\n\nThe older two, the British imperial system and the closely related US customary system use the foot as a measure of length, the pound as a measure for weight, and the second as a measure for time.

They can be divided into three groups: nine narrow main rings (6, 5, 4, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b7, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5), two dusty rings (1986U2R/\u03b6, \u03bb) and two outer rings (\u03bc, \u03bd). The rings of Uranus   consist mainly of macroscopic particles and  little dust, although dust is known to be present in 1986U2R/\u03b6, \u03b7, \u03b4, \u03bb, \u03bd and \u03bc rings.\n\nIn addition to these well-known rings, there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them. These faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily. Some of them became visible during a series of ring plane-crossing events in 2007.<ref name=dePater2007></ref> A number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward-scattering  geometry by ''Voyager 2''.

The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This shows that they are probably a mixture of the ice and a dark material.  The nature of this material is not clear, but it may be organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of the inner moons.<ref name=Baines1998/>\n\nAs a whole, the ring system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn, some of which are composed of very bright material\u2014water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the \u03b5 ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus.

Wants can be for the same things as needs. For example, a person can ''need'' to eat food and can ''want'' to eat cake. If there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else, perhaps bread. The need is no longer so important (the person is no longer hungry) although the want may still be there. If there is cake, then the person's needs and wants can both be met.\n\nIn economics, a want is about goods or services. Choice is how to satisfy a want, when there are different ways to do this.\n\nWant can also be the idea of what it means to be poor, hungry or with no money.

{"title": "Year", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "text": "One '''year''' is about 365 days long (except in a leap year). It is the time it takes the Earth to go completely around (orbit) the sun once. A year is actually 365.2422 days long, but a calendar has 365 days, except in a leap year.\n\nThe year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 in the Gregorian calendar, but a fiscal year or a school year can start on a different day of the year.\n\nThere are several ways used to measure the length of a year.\n\n* a '''solar''' year is based on the seasons. The Gregorian calendar is based on the solar year.  The solar year is 365 days long. \n** a '''tropical''' year is a solar year as measured between two vernal equinoxes, sometimes called the first day of spring. \n* a '''lunar''' year is based on the moon and is usually 12 lunar months (29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes each) or 354 days long.\n* a '''sidereal''' year measures the time between when a selected fixed star is highest in the night sky.\n* an '''anomalistic year''' is the difference between the times when the Earth gets closest to the sun.\n* an '''eclipse''' year is the time between node passages. This is when the sun moves through a part of the sky where it is possible for the sun, Earth and moon to be in a line. It is also when eclipses can happen.\n\nSolar and lunar years are used by different calendars for daily life.  The other measurements are used by astronomers.\n\n* There was no year numbered \"year zero\" in a normal system of counting, because it would mean there is a year earlier than the first year, which was the year AD one in the Anno Domini system, also called 1 CE in the Common Era, used with our Gregorian calendar.

Although there are many spoken Chinese languages, they use the same writing system.<ref>European languages similarly all use an alphabetic script.</ref> Differences in speaking are reflected in differences in writing.  Official China adopts a similar policy to the one in the Soviet Union, using one standard language.  In English we call the standard Chinese language Mandarin.  In mainland China they call it \"''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0''\" or \"common to everybody speech.\"  In Taiwan they call it \"''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4''\" or \"language of the whole country\".  All official documents are written in Mandarin, and Mandarin is taught all over China.  It is also a standard for language teaching in some other countries.  A standard language lets people in the same country understand each other.\n\nChinese is used by the Han people in China and other ethnic groups in China who are declared Chinese by the Chinese government. Chinese is almost always written in Chinese characters. They are symbols that have meaning, called logograms. They also give ''some'' indication of pronunciation, but the same character can get very different pronunciations among the different kinds of Chinese.  Since Chinese characters have been around for at least 3500 years, people in places far from each other say them differently, just as \"1, 2, 3\" can be read differently in different languages.\n\nChinese people needed to write down pronunciations in dictionaries. Chinese does not have an alphabet, so how to write down sounds was a big problem in the beginning. Nowadays the Mandarin language uses Hanyu pinyin to represent the sounds in Roman letters.\n\nAll the Chinese languages (or dialects) use tones.

The difference is important on a computer.

The zero with a dot in the centre seems to have begun as a choice on IBM 3270 controllers (this has the problem that it looks like the Greek letter theta). The slashed zero, looking like the letter O with a diagonal line drawn inside it, is used in old-style ASCII graphic sets that came from the default typewheel on the well-known ASR-33 Teletype. This format causes problems because it looks like the symbol <math>\\emptyset</math>, representing the empty set, as well as for certain Scandinavian languages which use \u00d8 as a letter.\n \nThe rule which has the letter O with a slash and the zero without was used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers; this is even more of a problem for Scandinavians because it looks like two of their letters at the same time. Some Burroughs/Unisys computers display a zero with a backwards slash. And yet another convention common on early line printers left zero without any extra dots or slashes but added a tail or hook to the letter O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter O.\n\n\nThe letters used on some European number plates for cars make the two symbols look different. This is done by making the zero rather egg-shaped and the O more circular, but most of all by cutting open the zero on the upper right side, so the circle is not closed any more (as in ).

The earliest was the Olmec culture in the south. The Olmecs are famous for the large stone heads they made. On the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula lived the Mayans. The Mayans lived in city states ruled by kings. The Mayans were most powerful between 200 and 900 A.D. Another powerful empire belonged to Teotihuacan. Teotihuacan was a very large city, one of the largest at that time. After Teotihuacan declined the Toltecs became powerful. Things made by the Toltecs have been found from the southern parts of the U.S. all the way to Costa Rica. A famous Toltec god is Quetzalcoatl. The Toltec culture declined too, and it was succeeded by the Aztecs. The Aztecs called their own empire Mexico. A famous Aztec king was Moctezuma II.\n\nIn 1519 the Spanish explorer Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s came to Mexico. The Aztecs thought he was the returned Quetzalcoatl, so they did not want to fight against him. Cortes allied himself with the enemies of the Aztecs. In 1521 they conquered the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Empire became part of Spain. It was called New Spain.\n\nIn 1810 the Mexican priest Miguel Hidalgo started the Mexican war of independence. In 1821 the Spanish finally retreated and Mexico became independent. The first leader of independent Mexico was Agustin de Iturbide. He set up the First Mexican Empire and became emperor. But the Mexicans were not happy with him, and in 1823 the country became a republic.\n\nA man who was very important in Mexico in the early 19th century was Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. He was the president of Mexico 11 times. When he became a dictator, Texas declared independence (1836). The Battle of the Alamo was part of this Texas Revolution. Between 1846 and 1848 there was war between Mexico and the United States. In this war Mexico lost its large northern areas, which became the southwestern United States. After this war Santa Anna was sent away to Venezuela.\n\nBetween 1858 and 1861 there was war again, between liberals and conservatives. The liberal Benito Ju\u00e1rez won the war and became president afterwards. Juarez stayed president until France invaded Mexico and made Maximilian of Habsburg emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. But Maximilian was very unpopular. After more war he was executed in 1867, and Juarez became president again.\n\nConservatives thought Juarez had too much power. In 1876 they ousted him, and made Porfirio D\u00edaz, a general who had won a battle against the French, president. Porfirio D\u00edaz made the country wealthier, but the poor people became poorer. Franciso I. Madero started the Mexican Revolution in 1910.\n\nThe next 10 years the country was in chaos. There were many presidents who ruled for a short time and all kinds of people fought against each other. Famous people from this period are Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa and Francisco I. Madero. When \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n became president in 1920 the fighting calmed down.\n\nIn 1929 President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles founded the National Mexican Party, PNM. The party was later renamed Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. The party would rule for a very long time. Most PRI presidents were not popular, it was said that they were only president to become richer themselves. An exception was president L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. He was president between 1934 and 1940.\n\nAfter several decades more and more people became unhappy with the PRI.

Together with other mercury compounds, Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was used to treat syphilis. The problem with this was that mercury(II) chloride is very toxic. Sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat.<ref></ref> It is also used as a disinfectant. , a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 1800s for different conditions such as constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches.<ref></ref> In the early 20th century, mercury was given to children once a year as a laxative and dewormer. Teething powders for infants also had it in them. \n\nSince the 1930s some vaccines have contained the preservative thiomersal. In the body, this is changed to ethylmercury.

For this reason, cinnabar has recently been replaced with less toxic products. \n\nToday, the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. Thermometers and blood pressure devices using mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively.

The Central Intelligence Agency led US efforts abroad, while the FBI did counterespionage. Catching foreign spies was among KGB functions, as well as fighting domestic subversion.\n\nIn the USSR, the dictator Joseph Stalin died and Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev (1953) took his place.  Khrushchev later took sole control of the USSR.  Khrushchev's Secret Speech marked a period of de-Stalinization and Khrushchev tried to undo many of the things Stalin did (such as the Gulag prison camps and 'cult of personality').\n\nIn the United States, there was a \"Red Scare\", and when the USSR detonated its own atom bomb, there was a great deal of political fallout.  Famous people, in many fields who had been Communist sympathizers in the past lost their positions.  Many actors were 'blacklisted' and were not hired to act in movies, ruining their careers. Senator Joseph McCarthy accused some important Americans of being communists, including some high government officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1950s were the beginning of the space race between the United States and USSR. It began with the USSR putting the Sputnik satellite into orbit around the Earth, making the Soviet Union the first country in space. The United States responded by starting NASA, and soon sent up its own satellites. The Soviet Union also sent the first man (Yuri Gagarin) into Earth orbit, claiming that this proved communism was the better ideology.\n\nIn the 1950s, the United States (under president Dwight Eisenhower) created a policy called \"New Look,\" cutting defense spending and increasing the number of nuclear weapons as a deterrent in order to prevent the Soviet Union from attacking the USA.  The USSR also increased their nuclear force, resulting in  mutual assured destruction.\n\nIn the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Cold War alliances were broken for the first time with the Soviet Union and United States favouring one side, and Britain and France the other. Later that year, the Western allies did not interfere when Soviet troops suppressed an anti-communist revolution in Hungary.\n\nUnited States Vice-President Richard Nixon engaged in several talks with Nikita Khrushchev during the 1950s. One of these was the 1959 \"Kitchen Debate\" in a model kitchen in Moscow. These debates highlighted the political and economic differences between the USA and the USSR. The following year, the United States U-2 spy plane crashed in the Soviet Union.

The United States began to support anti-communists all over the world with money and weapons. The idea was to help them overthrow their communist governments.\n\nThe Soviet Union had a slow economy during this decade because military spending was at an all-time high. They tried to keep up with the United States in military spending, but could not. In the Soviet war in Afghanistan starting in 1979, the Soviet Union had a difficult time fighting resistance groups, some of them armed and trained by the United States. The Soviet Union's failed invasion of Afghanistan is often compared to the United States' failure during the Vietnam War.\n\n\nIn the late 1980s the new Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev made an effort to make an ally of the United States to fix world problems caused by the war, with the ultimate aim of eliminating nuclear weapons completely. However, this did not take place because the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, insisted on having a nuclear missile defense system. The people of the Soviet Union were divided on their feelings about this. Some wanted President Gorbachev to fight harder to eliminate nuclear weapons, while others did not want him to be talking to the United States at all. These mixed feelings created an atmosphere of political in-fighting, and the people were no longer united behind one goal. Because of this, the Communist Party started to crumble.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and without Communist rule holding together the countries that comprised the Soviet Union, the USSR broke into smaller countries, like Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Georgia.

It is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby. Climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification was the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, first made by Wladimir K\u00f6ppen. The Thornthwaite system,<ref>C. W. Thornthwaite, \"An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate\", ''Geographical Review'', 38:55-94, 1948</ref> which was used from 1948, not only uses temperature and precipitation information, but evapotranspiration too.

The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus more on where the air masses which help make climates come from.\n\nClimates can change after a long time.

That means that they breathe air and do not lay eggs. Many different kinds of whales live in the oceans around Antarctica. \nWhalers have hunted whales for hundreds of years, for meat and blubber.  Nowadays most whaling is done in the Antarctic area.\n\nPenguins only live south of the equator. Several different kinds live in and around Antarctica. The biggest ones can stand nearly 4 feet (1.2m) tall and can weigh almost 100 pounds (40&nbsp;kg). The smallest kinds are only about one foot (30&nbsp;cm) tall. Penguins are large birds that swim very well but cannot fly. They have black backs and wings with white fronts.  Their feathers are very tightly packed and make a thick cover.  They also have a layer of woolly down under the feathers.  The feathers themselves are coated with a type of oil that makes them waterproof.<ref name=lifepac/>   A thick layer of blubber also keeps them warm.  Penguins eat fish and are at home in the ocean.  They come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks.

He suggested this idea to keep the balance of all known lands in the world. Pictures of a large land in the south were common in maps. In the late 17th century, people discovered that South America and Australia were not part of the mythical \"Antarctica\". However, geographers still believed that Antarctica was much bigger than it really was.\n\nEuropean maps continued to show this unknown land until Captain James Cook's ships, HMS ''Resolution'' and ''Adventure'', crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773.<ref name=mariner/> They crossed it again in January 1774.<ref name=mariner></ref> In fact, Cook did come within about  of the Antarctic coast.

The three men were Fabian von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (an American seal hunter out of Stonington, Connecticut). The first recorded landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis. He landed on West Antarctica on 7 February 1821. However, some historians are not sure about this claim.\n\nPeople began discovering different parts of Antarctica and mapping them. This was slow work because they could only work in the summer.<ref name=lifepac/> At last a map was made, and people began to talk about exploring the land, not only the sea.<ref name=lifepac/> However, this would have been very hard work. They would have to break through the ice that was around Antarctica.

They were the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 \u2013 February 1909.

People can tell that they are at these poles by looking at the stars (at the poles, a star just circles around at the same height, never dipping to the horizon). The Sun rises once a year and gives the South Pole half a year of summer but it is always cold. When the Sun sets half a year later it makes half a year of winter which is even colder. The South Pole is always cold because the Sun never rises high in the sky. \n\nThe south magnetic pole is something different. It is defined by the Earth's magnetic field, as roughly where a magnetic compass needle points. People can tell they are near these poles by looking at a compass.

Unlike the North pole, which is covered by the sea and flat sea-ice, the South Pole is on a mountainous continent. This continent is called Antarctica. It is covered by thick ice (more than a mile thick in the centre). The south Pole is very high up, and is very windy. It is far from places where people live, and ships going there often have to find their way through thick sea ice. Once ashore, land-travelling explorers have to travel more than a thousand miles to get to the pole. They must cross a floating ice shelf, then up onto the ice-covered land, up steep mountain glaciers covered in broken, twisted ice slowly sliding to the sea, and across a high level land (\"plateau\") covered in ice and swept by strong freezing winds.\n\nTwo expeditions early in the 20th century, led by Robert Falcon Scott and then Ernest Shackleton, failed to reach the South Pole, but returned safely. Shackleton turned back quite close to the pole, but it was late in the season and supplies were low. He knew that he would be risking the lives of his men, so he turned back.\n\nThe first men to reach the South Pole were a group from Norway led by Roald Amundsen. They arrived at the Pole on December 14, 1911 and left the Norwegian flag. Amundsen and his men returned home safely. Amundsen's story is one of excellent planning, good leadership, and willingness to learn from others: this made extreme endurance unnecessary, and perhaps made the successful expedition less of a story, and therefore perhaps less famous, than the next one.\n\nThe most famous South Pole expedition is perhaps the one that failed badly. This was the British expedition (not just UK, it included people from the British Empire, who at that time were considered British citizens) led by Robert Falcon Scott. Scott and four other men, dragging their equipment on sledges, had hoped to be first to the Pole. When they arrived, they saw a Norwegian flag. A letter left for Scott showed that Amundsen and his men had beaten them by a month, by using dogs to pull their sledges.\n\nOn their journey back from the Pole, Scott's team found that food \"dumps\" were short of supplies, particularly kerosene. Kerosene was very important: not just for cooking but for melting ice. Once it ran out, they would have no water to drink. One man collapsed and died while walking. Oates knew his frostbitten feet could not carry him back to base, and that he might delay his companions and risk their lives. He committed suicide by walking out of their tent into the cold. Scott and his remaining two companions died of starvation, thirst, and cold - trapped in the tent by bad weather until their supplies ran out. Next spring, the three bodies in the tent were found by a team from the main part of the expedition - who had spent the winter in the expeditions's hut by the sea. Scott's letters to his wife, written in the tent when he knew he was going to die, have just (Jan 2007) been made public.\n\nApart from Ernest Shackleton's expedition to cross the Antarctic (another heroic failure, but Shackleton saved all his men, after a very courageous sea crossing in an open boat, and a crossing of an unknown mountain range while starving and freezing), this was the end of the \"heroic\" age of exploration. Motors, Planes, Radios, and GPS ensured that following expeditions were never truly \"unsupported\".\n\nToday there is an American science base at the South Pole. It is named the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to honor the two explorers.", "paragraphs": [[[0, 139, 4924, 30, 605, 4, 1022], [2633, 0, 193, 4924, 42, 30, 1333, 21, 0, 937, 5, 2983, 937, 1718, 0, 139, 4924, 30, 13, 7, 8411, 4944], [37, 4944, 30, 580, 12451], [20, 30, 1333, 21, 4950, 1718, 181, 73, 7, 2586, 4950, 6, 0, 1437], [0, 139, 4924, 30, 191, 152, 60, 5, 30, 191, 18082], [20, 30, 372, 25, 241, 111, 69, 682, 5, 1370, 242, 63, 456, 33, 4, 596, 44, 179, 131, 4950, 937, 1718], [442, 12927, 607, 1143, 8627, 33, 4, 1143, 181, 73, 7, 4119, 2586, 4, 169, 4, 0, 4924], [39, 390, 1007, 7, 11947, 1718, 10667, 127, 60, 2178, 0, 1718, 1333, 607, 60, 6625, 1611, 9682, 1333, 6, 1129, 8558, 1718, 3892, 5689, 4, 0, 937, 5, 531, 7, 152, 505, 607, 9352, 1333, 6, 1718, 5, 6028, 21, 562, 5381, 2486]], [[55, 5499, 199, 6, 0, 589, 410, 21, 893, 14369, 1893, 5, 127, 9668, 37346, 4355, 4, 1022, 0, 139, 4924, 34, 498, 7024], [37346, 890, 137, 1689, 383, 4, 0, 4924, 34, 20, 30, 288, 6, 0, 195, 5, 1646, 30, 653], [18, 346, 12, 18, 54, 30, 1118, 0, 682, 3, 26, 300, 100, 18, 890, 137]], [[0, 300, 4, 1022, 0, 139, 4924, 30, 7, 129, 25, 2819, 410, 21, 53402, 48979], [39, 3704, 22, 0, 4924, 13, 470, 5, 891, 0, 3594, 2808], [48979, 5, 26, 300, 498, 163, 7024], [48979, 523, 30, 48, 3, 4345, 394, 219, 1356, 5, 6358, 4, 2368, 25, 68, 37, 159, 3828, 13616, 8671, 5, 1472, 159, 0, 1299, 5499, 333, 3, 7, 523, 5, 2317, 1472, 333, 1613, 73, 0, 182, 48]], [[0, 181, 1613, 139, 4924, 5499, 30, 1472, 0, 48, 12, 4355, 3914], [37, 30, 0, 297, 5499, 36, 120, 2046, 20, 488, 69, 25, 0, 297, 2552, 38, 22, 12, 79, 30, 1568, 297, 3941, 410, 21, 893, 14369, 1893], [1893, 5, 133, 68, 300, 7280, 44, 1404, 13, 42573, 33, 824, 4, 30, 4, 0, 4924], [61, 39, 3704, 39, 253, 7, 3594, 2808], [7, 1258, 891, 10, 1893, 273, 12, 48979, 5, 26, 300, 33, 960, 101, 21, 7, 229, 21, 234, 2926, 4, 2933, 44, 42573]], [[13, 44, 3930, 137, 25, 0, 4924, 1893, 145, 596, 12, 565, 9777, 30, 636, 3, 1646, 1113, 24046], [24046, 30, 191, 481, 36, 120, 10, 3387, 34, 10, 15426, 1718], [442, 20, 307, 66, 39, 54, 33, 84, 430, 4, 4603], [48, 300, 2788, 5, 2357, 110, 2385], [17786, 346, 26, 110233, 2149, 86, 36, 1619, 103, 137, 4, 815, 5, 12, 18, 107, 2676, 26, 7752, 5, 1118, 44, 682], [18, 5263, 1523, 21, 2385, 66, 3, 44, 8301, 75, 0, 1866], [1893, 5, 26, 944, 55, 7752, 2357, 3, 14075, 22686, 5, 1866, 8784, 6, 0, 8301, 21, 978, 1620, 207, 44, 1646, 307, 66], [182, 1509, 0, 87, 719, 6, 0, 8301, 30, 596, 21, 7, 145, 25, 0, 444, 153, 3, 0, 5499, 38, 33, 2025, 0, 1601, 6, 0, 5499, 14131, 21, 0, 937], [1893, 1258, 4, 26, 702, 2432, 6, 0, 8301, 61, 18, 346, 18, 30, 242, 4, 2357, 33, 120, 4187, 30, 159, 198]], [[2725, 25, 9668, 37346, 5499, 4, 1007, 0, 10234, 170, 12192, 1899, 34, 37346, 1753, 64, 26, 300, 49, 7, 191, 14919, 937, 1007, 6, 7, 310, 2377, 5, 7, 1007, 3, 7, 2949, 1611, 1006, 110, 30656, 5, 5381, 37, 30, 0, 156, 3, 0, 12192, 464, 3, 5679], [4658, 2778, 15589, 5, 14650, 1810, 12, 1816, 5499, 30, 332, 4702, 47165]], [[373, 63, 30, 7, 140, 1121, 815, 22, 0, 139, 4924], [20, 30, 311, 0, 48979, 1893, 139, 4924, 515, 4, 2384, 0, 55, 8627]]]}, {"title": "Climate", "text": "The South Pole has a desert climate.

''Inuit'' means more than one, one person is an \"''Inuk''\". The native Greenlanders are related to the Inuit. The language of the Inuit is Inuktitut, and it is one of the official languages of Nunavut and of the Northwest Territories in Canada. Eskimo is a term more frequently used in mainstream United States where such concerns get less attention.\n\nInuits in Alaska have various concerns, such as protecting the caribou from American oil pipelines.

Whale blubber was burned as fuel for cooking and lamps.\n\nInuit were also Nomadic people, but they did not domesticate any animals except for dogs, which they used to pull their sleds and help with the hunting. They were hunter-gatherer<nowiki/>s, living off the land. They were very careful to make good use of every part of the animals they killed. Respect for the land and the animals they harvested was and is a focal part of their culture.\n\nInuit lived in tents made of animal skins during the summer. In the winter they lived in sod houses and igloos. They could build an igloo out of snow bricks in just a couple of hours. Snow is full of air spaces, which helps it hold in warmth. With just a blubber lamp for heat, an igloo could be warmer than the air outside. The Inuit made very clever things from the bones, antlers, and wood they had. They invented the , which was used to hunt seals and whales. They built boats from wood or bone covered with animal skins. They invented the ''kayak'' for one man to use for hunting the ocean and among the pack ice.\n\nInuit sleds could be built from wood, bone, or even animal skins wrapped around frozen fish. Dishes were made from carving soapstone, bones, or musk ox horns. They wore two layers of skins, one fur side in, the other facing out, to stay warm.\n\nInuit had to be good hunters to survive. When an animal was killed in a hunt, it was thanked respectfully for offering itself to the hunter. They believed it intended to provide itself as a gift towards the survival of the hunter and his children. Their gratitude was deeply sincere and is an important aspect of their belief system. In the winter, seals did not come out onto the ice. They only came up for air at holes they chewed in the ice. Inuit would use their dogs to find the air holes, then wait patiently until the seal came back to breathe and kill it with a . In the summer, the seals would lie out on the ice enjoying the sun. The hunter would have to slowly creep up on a seal to kill it. The Inuit would use their dogs and spears to hunt polar bears, musk ox, and caribou. Sometimes they would kill caribou from their boats as the animals crossed the rivers on their migration.\n\nThe Inuit even hunted whales. From their boat, they would throw harpoons that were attached to floats made of  seal skins. The whale would grow tired from dragging the floats under the water. When it slowed down and came up to the surface, the Inuit could keep hitting it with more harpoons or spears until it died. Whale blubber provide Vitamin D and Omegas to their cultural diet, and prevented rickets. The whaling industry around the world has depleted the whale population, and now traditional whale hunting for subsistence purposes is rare around the world. Inuits have added to their modern northern diet with grocery foods, which are normally very expensive in the north.\n\nDuring the summer months, the Inuit were able to gather berries and roots to eat. They also collected grass to line their boots or make baskets. Often the food they found or killed during the summer was put into a ''cache'' for use during the long winter. A cache was created by digging down to the permafrost and building a rock lined pit there. The top would be covered with a pile of rocks to keep out the animals. It was as good as a freezer, because the food would stay frozen there until the family needed it. Inuit cultural traditions and traditional stories provided each new generation with the lifeskills and knowledge to survive their environment and work together. They usually moved around in small groups looking for food, and sometimes they would get together with other groups to hunt for larger animals such as whales. The men did the hunting and home building, and also made weapons, sleds, and boats. The women cooked, made the clothes, and took care of the children. Children and infants under the ages of 5 became easy victims of hypothermia, and if they were to die, their mothers would weight the children's corpses with stones and wrap them in fishnets before placing the bodies through holes in the ice. The mothers believed the children's souls were being offered to the god Phallus, who would reincarnate them as whales.", "paragraphs": [[[24468, 3623, 150, 4781, 5, 3387, 3806, 5, 2120, 7, 219, 7, 0, 18411, 3, 5508, 2694], [9287, 61190, 30, 6292, 7, 1397, 10, 3387, 5, 15880]], [[24468, 30, 52, 20838, 69, 34, 39, 88, 36, 147333, 130, 2694, 2077, 10, 2926, 42, 39, 234, 4, 2933, 44, 24293, 5, 275, 17, 0, 3985], [39, 30, 5210, 88682], [682, 138, 0, 607], [39, 30, 191, 5604, 4, 159, 219, 234, 3, 359, 153, 3, 0, 2694, 39, 1916], [1983, 10, 0, 607, 5, 0, 2694, 39, 6970, 30, 5, 30, 7, 14577, 153, 3, 44, 1295]], [[24468, 682, 6, 8301, 159, 3, 2694, 3825, 105, 0, 740], [6, 0, 1601, 39, 682, 6, 39747, 166, 5, 70086], [39, 86, 1190, 7, 70086, 66, 3, 2642, 6062, 6, 120, 7, 1334, 3, 1152], [2642, 30, 549, 3, 325, 863, 42, 275, 20, 802, 6, 15660], [17, 120, 7, 61190, 15880, 10, 1965, 7, 70086, 86, 30, 3547, 73, 0, 325, 587], [0, 24468, 159, 191, 11114, 873, 25, 0, 5226, 74219, 5, 2753, 39, 33], [39, 24073, 0, 42, 30, 234, 4, 3985, 5874, 5, 9287], [39, 1190, 2377, 25, 2753, 46, 5226, 1333, 17, 2694, 3825], [39, 24073, 0, 25460, 10, 48, 300, 4, 234, 10, 3985, 0, 2561, 5, 244, 0, 5158, 1718]], [[24468, 24293, 86, 30, 1190, 25, 2753, 5226, 46, 151, 2694, 3825, 9007, 204, 5381, 2120], [8458, 30, 159, 25, 18393, 101128, 5226, 46, 41683, 29585, 6832], [39, 3433, 55, 6828, 3, 3825, 48, 9718, 437, 6, 0, 68, 621, 66, 4, 1087, 3547]], [[24468, 33, 4, 30, 219, 5210, 4, 3981], [61, 7, 2694, 30, 1916, 6, 7, 3985, 20, 30, 5551, 33233, 10, 901, 1003, 4, 0, 5210], [39, 733, 20, 7434, 4, 761, 1003, 7, 7, 4130, 1811, 0, 5300, 3, 0, 5210, 5, 26, 964], [44, 13650, 30, 3601, 12085, 5, 30, 7, 481, 6395, 3, 44, 4440, 278], [6, 0, 1601, 5874, 88, 36, 326, 66, 2178, 0, 1718], [39, 91, 326, 60, 10, 325, 22, 2924, 39, 20961, 6, 0, 1718], [24468, 54, 234, 44, 2926, 4, 596, 0, 325, 2924, 127, 2472, 22855, 207, 0, 5874, 326, 137, 4, 12501, 5, 1916, 20, 17, 7], [6, 0, 740, 0, 5874, 54, 4621, 66, 13, 0, 1718, 3710, 0, 1662], [0, 5210, 54, 33, 4, 3892, 23311, 60, 13, 7, 5874, 4, 1916, 20], [0, 24468, 54, 234, 44, 2926, 5, 20143, 4, 3985, 10158, 3045, 41683, 29585, 5, 32803], [1071, 39, 54, 1916, 32803, 25, 44, 2377, 7, 0, 2694, 1007, 0, 620, 13, 44, 7291]], [[0, 24468, 151, 3985, 9287], [25, 44, 2377, 39, 54, 3375, 45274, 12, 30, 14689, 4, 11947, 159, 3, 5874, 3825], [0, 9287, 54, 2274, 8813, 25, 7280, 0, 11947, 124, 0, 430], [61, 20, 2049, 135, 5, 326, 60, 4, 0, 2283, 0, 24468, 86, 578, 416, 20, 17, 181, 45274, 46, 20143, 207, 20, 2357], [9287, 61190, 761, 12363, 1968, 5, 348884, 4, 44, 1704, 5596, 5, 1449, 97104], [0, 11926, 459, 204, 0, 85, 33, 50564, 0, 9287, 485, 5, 114, 1274, 9287, 3985, 10, 22668, 2800, 30, 2348, 204, 0, 85], [128768, 33, 1679, 4, 44, 1194, 529, 5596, 17, 8551, 565, 42, 30, 3520, 191, 2921, 6, 0, 193]], [[105, 0, 740, 229, 0, 24468, 30, 667, 4, 5703, 9307, 5, 5440, 4, 3623], [39, 52, 5198, 4614, 4, 331, 44, 10002, 46, 159, 7983], [456, 0, 565, 39, 596, 46, 1916, 105, 0, 740, 30, 339, 75, 7, 13482, 10, 234, 105, 0, 173, 1601], [7, 13482, 30, 1210, 21, 8563, 135, 4, 0, 45690, 5, 1190, 7, 1137, 331, 6576, 63], [0, 220, 54, 30, 1333, 17, 7, 9623, 3, 1137, 4, 578, 66, 0, 2694], [20, 30, 7, 219, 7, 7, 21456, 113, 0, 565, 54, 1087, 5381, 63, 207, 0, 213, 408, 20], [24468, 1704, 2836, 5, 1274, 523, 761, 236, 50, 2064, 17, 0, 5, 2489, 4, 3981, 44, 1557, 5, 161, 600], [39, 1140, 483, 204, 6, 357, 129, 662, 10, 565, 5, 1071, 39, 54, 169, 600, 17, 68, 129, 4, 3985, 10, 426, 2694, 125, 7, 9287], [0, 300, 88, 0, 3985, 5, 163, 1190, 5, 52, 159, 4034, 24293, 5, 2377], [0, 787, 3387, 159, 0, 70623, 5, 190, 757, 3, 0, 964], [271, 5, 8265, 124, 0, 464, 3, 399, 1673, 3122, 3, 34512, 5, 83, 39, 30, 4, 2357, 44, 808, 54, 2555, 0, 964, 14244, 17, 2155, 5, 9007, 101, 6, 87747, 106, 241, 0, 719, 131, 2924, 6, 0, 1718], [0, 808, 733, 0, 964, 4184, 30, 30, 901, 4, 0, 1533, 84461, 38, 54, 138801, 101, 7, 9287]]]}, {"title": "North American Arctic people today", "text": "Today, most Inuit live in modern houses.

Besides, commercial winterwear is expensive.  They use rifles and snowmobile<nowiki/>s when hunting now, however traditional values respecting the animals hunted still very much applies.  In Alaska, many of the people have received money from the oil discovered in that state on their traditional lands. \n\nThe Arctic is very different from the rest of the world that the way of life in the south does not work well in the north. Canada values having Inuit peoples in Canada's northernmost lands as proof of sovereignty over the Canadian portion of the Arctic Circle.  It's a very challenging living in an Arctic environment.  There is some controversy over the practice of sinking the corpses of child victims of hypothermia under the ice, as bodies have been known to drift through the currents and wash up on the eastern coast of Canada, and, upon occasion, the northeastern United States.\n\n\n\n\n<!-- interwiki -->", "paragraphs": [[[373, 181, 24468, 682, 6, 1194, 166], [109, 149, 3985, 46, 2120, 10, 7, 224, 153, 3, 44, 565, 1646, 5, 1071, 77, 1017], [5874, 37617, 30, 234, 4, 1508, 25, 0, 3828, 1866, 6, 0, 7574, 5, 30, 372, 181, 2037, 73, 300, 159, 9212], [0, 732, 30, 161, 219, 10, 109, 4119, 3, 62], [3606, 1196, 30, 2921], [39, 234, 5892, 5, 41306, 61, 3985, 114, 212, 1274, 1158, 1983, 0, 2694, 3985, 149, 191, 181, 3515], [6, 4604, 109, 3, 0, 69, 33, 1653, 308, 25, 0, 316, 6314, 6, 12, 92, 13, 44, 1274, 607]], [[0, 7574, 30, 191, 494, 25, 0, 1033, 3, 0, 85, 12, 0, 179, 3, 214, 6, 0, 139, 14219, 36, 161, 219, 6, 0, 193], [774, 1158, 33, 24468, 69, 6, 774, 20913, 607, 7, 4295, 3, 4519, 74, 0, 1202, 2939, 3, 0, 7574, 4012], [7, 191, 1448, 682, 6, 7, 7574, 1557], [63, 30, 77, 3187, 74, 0, 1276, 3, 9241, 0, 14244, 3, 964, 3122, 3, 34512, 124, 0, 1718, 7, 719, 33, 30, 346, 4, 13674, 131, 0, 533, 5, 9034, 60, 13, 0, 828, 954, 3, 774, 5, 1219, 4979, 0, 4818, 104, 112]], [], [[], []]]}]}

Software includes all different software programs on a computer, such as applications and the operating system. Applications are programs that are designed to perform a specific operation, such as a game or a word processor. The operating system including Mac OS, Microsoft Windows and Linux is an open source software that is used as a platform for running the applications, and controls all user interface tools including display and the keyboard. People, processes and tools are considered as essential ingredient of software design.\n\nThe word software was first used in the late 1960s to emphasize on its difference from computer hardware, which can be physically observed by the user. Software is a set of instructions that the computer follows. Before compact discs (CDs) or development of the Internet age, software was used on various computer data storage media tools like paper punch cards, magnetic discs or magnetic tape<nowiki/>s.\n\nThe word firmware is sometimes used to describe a style of software that is made specifically for a particular type of computer or an electronic device and is usually stored on a Flash memory or ROM chip in the computer. Firmware usually refers to a piece of software that directly controls a piece of hardware. The firmware for a CD drive or the firmware for a modem are examples of firmware implementation. \n\nToday, software has become an inseparable part of our lives. We are using software everywhere. Software engineers are responsible for producing fault-free software which has literally become an essential part of our daily lives.

Televisions receive broadcasting signals and turn them into pictures and sound. The word \"television\" comes from the words ''tele'' (Greek for ''far away'') and ''vision'' (''sight'').\n\nSometimes a television can look like a box. Older TVs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture.  Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter.\n\nA TV can show pictures from many television networks.  Computers and mobile devices also can be used for watching television programs.\n\nTelevision was invented in the 1920s but the equipment was expensive and the pictures were poor. By the 1950s, these problems had been fixed and TVs became widespread.\n\nAt first, all televisions used an antenna (or aerial). This would pick up television programmes from broadcasting stations. A TV station could be many miles or kilometers away, and still be received. TVs can also show movies from VCD and DVD players or VCRs. Cable TV and Satellite television can provide more programs at once than broadcast can. Video game consoles connect to most modern TVs. Some computers can also use a TV as a computer monitor.\n\nAll TVs have screens where the picture is viewed.  Before the 1950s these were usually \"black and white\", which made everything look grey, but all modern TVs show colors.  Most 20th century screens also had rounded corners.  That is because television screens were cathode ray tubes.  These are like heavy glass jars with one side bulging out to form the screen.  \n\nToday flat panel displays are the usual kind.  These are usually flat rectangles with straight edges.  This long rectangle looks more like the shape of a movie theatre screen.  This is called widescreen.  If a widescreen set was 30&nbsp;cm tall, it would be 53&nbsp;cm wide.  For this to work best, TV shows also need to be made in widescreen.

The problems caused by the change to an industrial society, where many people moved to cities and worked in factories, were an early focus of sociology.

Beer is made by adding warm water to malted barley and other grains. The enzymes in the barley change the malted barley and other grains into simple sugars. This is called the mash. The water is then sparged (drained) from the grain. The water is now called wort. The wort is boiled and hops are added. Hops provide flavour and preserve the beer. After boiling the wort is cooled and yeast is added. The yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and the wort into beer.\n\nDifferent beers can have different natures, depending on the ingredients used; for example, an ale uses top fermenting yeast. Top fermenting yeasts eat more sugar and produce more alcohol. A lager uses bottom fermenting yeast. Bottom fermenting yeasts eat less sugar and produce a crisper, cleaner taste. Adding hops makes the beer more bitter and aromatic. Specialty malts (different types of cooked barley) produce different flavours and colours. These flavours and colours are most notable in dark beers like Porter and Stout.\n\nDifferent countries have different ways to make beer. In Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia, beer is usually made from just hops, malt, water, and yeast. This is because of the Reinheitsgebot. The Reinheitsgebot was a law that said says that beer can only be made from hops, malt, and water. Yeast was discovered after the Reinheitsgebot. The law was overturned by the European Union in 1992.
